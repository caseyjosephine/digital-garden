  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m Casey Jo. This is my digital garden — a living space for the things I’m learning, reading, making, and thinking about.</p>

  <p>By day I sell wine, and by night I’m usually surrounded by books and sketchpads. I’m drawn to the slightly magical and the delightfully obscure.</p>

  <p>This site is meant to evolve — like a notebook crossed with a greenhouse. Expect some loose ends and half-grown ideas.</p>

  <p>If you're curious, check out <a href="/reviews">my book reviews</a> or explore <a href="/art">some of my artwork</a>.</p>
