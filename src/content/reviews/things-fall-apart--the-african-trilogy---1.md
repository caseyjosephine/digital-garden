My Review: 'Freshman year of high school, honors English. I was fourteen, and all
  I wanted was to eventually be granted entrance into the cognoscenti. More than a
  signed photograph of Mark Hoppus, more than a super-low rise pair of light-wash
  jeans, which is to say that I wanted it more than anything. There were pretty much
  three routes out of my one-horse town: a football scholarship, rehab, or an imprudent
  amount of student loans taken out at a decent university. Being not much of a linebacker,
  and having no access to meth, I set my sights on the latter option. <br/><br/>Things
  Fall Apart helped me realize that books would change my life. It transported me
  to a place that I never knew existed, and put me in the shoes of a people that never
  got even a perfunctory mention in my world history class. I was a pretty big fish
  in a claustrophobically small pond, and Things Fall Apart was one of the books that
  made me realize how little of the world I actually knew. <br/><br/>I was surprised
  by the extent to which Achebe made me check my assumptions. I was looking for a
  way out, while Okonkwo desperately tried to maintain his influence in a decreasingly
  insular society. Okonkwo''s tribe fought to hold onto their traditions; I couldn''t
  wait to shed mine.<br/><br/>Surely, the second coming was not at hand for me, but
  when you''re a teenager the world revolves around your slightly-tilted narcissistic
  axis. At the time, this book spoke directory to me, and I couldn''t be more grateful.'
