My Review: 'Wow.<br/><br/>After finishing this book, all I can do is keep repeating
  the word "wow." I say the word, I think for awhile, I glace back at the book, and
  say "wow" again. I can''t help it; it''s just that kind of book.<br/><br/>It''s
  hard to explain what this book is about. Steinbeck is a much better writer than
  I am, so I''ll use his words in my review: "I believe that there is one story in
  the world, and only one. . . . Humans are caught—in their lives, in their thoughts,
  in their hungers and ambitions, in their avarice and cruelty, and in their kindness
  and generosity too—in a net of good and evil. . . . There is no other story. A man,
  after he has brushed off the dust and chips of his life, will have left only the
  hard, clean questions: Was it good or was it evil? Have I done well—or ill?"<br/><br/>As
  I read this book, I couldn''t help feeling the strangest sense of deja vu. I''ve
  thought many things, privately, that I filed away in my brain and thought I''d never
  think again. These were secret thoughts, that I thought were mine alone, and the
  reason I kept them secret was because I was too afraid to share them. Afraid, because
  I thought them, and after thinking them I immediately wished that I hadn''t. But
  these thoughts did not belong to me: Steinbeck thought them first, and he was not
  afraid, and he wrote them down. <br/><br/>Now, I feel less afraid. Now, I feel more
  human.'
