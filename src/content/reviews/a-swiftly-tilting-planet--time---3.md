My Review: As a third grader, I picked up this fabulous series and read it from start
  to finish, then read it again and again. While my feelings towards all the books
  changed as I got older and began to understand them on a deeper level, I believe
  that this book evolved the most over time. While Meg sits in her childhood bedroom,
  she follows Charles Wallace on an epic journey through time on a night-long quest
  to save the world. <br/><br/>This book is deeply layered, and was able to stand
  up to guilty pleasure late night re-reads even after I reached adulthood. I would
  recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy, especially if you've read any of the rest
  of the series.
