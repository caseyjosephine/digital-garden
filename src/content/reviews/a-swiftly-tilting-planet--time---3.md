As a third grader, I picked up this fabulous series and read it from start to finish, then read it again and again. While my feelings towards all the books changed as I got older and began to understand them on a deeper level, I believe that this book evolved the most over time. While Meg sits in her childhood bedroom, she follows Charles Wallace on an epic journey through time on a night-long quest to save the world. <br/><br/>This book is deeply layered, and was able to stand up to guilty pleasure late night re-reads even after I reached adulthood. I would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy, especially if you've read any of the rest of the series.
