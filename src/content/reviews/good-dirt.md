Good Dirt is both an examination of a family heeling from trauma and an exploration of heirlooms as totems for family history. It’s ambitious, and author Charmaine Wilkerson manages to pull it off.<br/><br/>As someone who grew up in the art world, I thought I was fairly knowledgeable. Turns out, I had no idea about the ceramic artwork made by enslaved Americans. These are functional pieces that are also quietly subversive.
