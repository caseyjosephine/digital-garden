My Review: Good Dirt is both an examination of a family heeling from trauma and an
  exploration of heirlooms as totems for family history. It’s ambitious, and author
  Charmaine Wilkerson manages to pull it off.<br/><br/>As someone who grew up in the
  art world, I thought I was fairly knowledgeable. Turns out, I had no idea about
  the ceramic artwork made by enslaved Americans. These are functional pieces that
  are also quietly subversive. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/arts/design/-enslaved-potter-david-drake-museum.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4E4.qjjg.ljr1bNSlIYu7&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare">history
  is fascinating</a>, and I’m glad that Wilkerson’s book brings attention to this
  area of Black art history.
