2.5 stars, but I'm rounding down due to gratuitous violence, including a brief mention of violence towards animals. Now, I'm not opposed to violence; indeed, I can't imagine [b:Lord of the Flies|7624|Lord of the Flies|William Golding|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1327869409s/7624.jpg|2766512], or even [b:A Game of Thrones|13496|A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, #1)|George R.R. Martin|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1369520317s/13496.jpg|1466917], without bloodshed (also, Battle Royale is one of my favorite movies, so, yeah). There's a difference, though, between violent episodes that serve to establish the stakes within a particular fictional world, and violence that exists just to advance the plot. The former has emotional ramifications that can be cathartic for the reader, while the latter mostly signifies that a lazy writer has written themselves into a corner and doesn't feel like rewriting themselves out of it. When deus ex machina appears over and over and over again in the form of "blowing stuff up," that's a sign that a writer isn't ready for prime time.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the plot (if you can call it that) is a strange, Swedish version of Forrest Gump, in that the protagonist accidentally finds himself in all sorts of historically important situations. Lest you forget, Forrest Gump is mostly a terrible movie, its only redeeming quality being the inexplicable likability of Tom Hanks (and, also, a fairly decent soundtrack). The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared has no likable characters at all, and you'll have to supply your own soundtrack. I never thought that I give any sort of praise to Forrest Gump, so I'm surprised to find myself saying it's at least got an advantage over this 400 page disaster.<br/><br/>The moral of this story is that you shouldn't pick up a book based only on a clever title, because a clever title can't carry an entire novel. Also, if someone asks you to watch Forrest Gump, it's probably a good idea to decline.
