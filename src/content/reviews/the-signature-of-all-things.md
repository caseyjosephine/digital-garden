Elizabeth Gilbert has been hiding her cards. She bluffed her way to best-seller status with the inane Eat Pray Love, but it turns out she had pocket aces the whole time. I was reluctant to read The Signature of All Things, but relented when friends as picky as myself praised the hefty novel. I found the whole thing sprawling, philosophical, and populated with the type of characters I’d like to invite over for tea and conversation. <br/><br/>I had heard that The Signature of All Things was a book about mosses, and in many ways it is, but to call it just a book about mosses is to call Anna Karenina a book about a train. The story revolves around Alma Whittaker, although it does not start with her. It begins with Alma’s father, Henry, as a young man in Europe. I have to say that I enjoyed this bit the most: Henry’s a compelling character, and his botanical exploits take him all over the world.<br/><br/>We get Alma’s entire life story, from her birth in Philadelphia, to her early life as a botanist in her own right and her strange fascination with the spiritualist Ambrose Pike. <spoiler>An important note: it’s definitely not a great idea to ask about major relationship decisions by attempting to transmit one’s thoughts silently, through physical contact. That’s what therapists like to call poor communication.</spoiler>. The story can’t always maintain the intensity of the wonderful first section, but it does manage to stay lushly written and beautifully detailed throughout.<br/><br/>What I can’t understand is how such a talented writer could have written such a solipsistic travel memoir. I have to assume that it was either a money grab (who wouldn’t jump at a free, year long vacation) or that Gilbert is one of those people who just doesn’t do non-fiction well. My suggestion is to skip Eat Pray Love and grab this one instead: mosses beat whining any day.
