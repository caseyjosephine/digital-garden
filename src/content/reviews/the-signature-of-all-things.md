My Review: 'Elizabeth Gilbert has been hiding her cards. She bluffed her way to best-seller
  status with the inane Eat Pray Love, but it turns out she had pocket aces the whole
  time. I was reluctant to read The Signature of All Things, but relented when friends
  as picky as myself praised the hefty novel. I found the whole thing sprawling, philosophical,
  and populated with the type of characters I’d like to invite over for tea and conversation.
  <br/><br/>I had heard that The Signature of All Things was a book about mosses,
  and in many ways it is, but to call it just a book about mosses is to call Anna
  Karenina a book about a train. The story revolves around Alma Whittaker, although
  it does not start with her. It begins with Alma’s father, Henry, as a young man
  in Europe. I have to say that I enjoyed this bit the most: Henry’s a compelling
  character, and his botanical exploits take him all over the world.<br/><br/>We get
  Alma’s entire life story, from her birth in Philadelphia, to her early life as a
  botanist in her own right and her strange fascination with the spiritualist Ambrose
  Pike. <spoiler>An important note: it’s definitely not a great idea to ask about
  major relationship decisions by attempting to transmit one’s thoughts silently,
  through physical contact. That’s what therapists like to call poor communication.</spoiler>.
  The story can’t always maintain the intensity of the wonderful first section, but
  it does manage to stay lushly written and beautifully detailed throughout.<br/><br/>What
  I can’t understand is how such a talented writer could have written such a solipsistic
  travel memoir. I have to assume that it was either a money grab (who wouldn’t jump
  at a free, year long vacation) or that Gilbert is one of those people who just doesn’t
  do non-fiction well. My suggestion is to skip Eat Pray Love and grab this one instead:
  mosses beat whining any day.'
