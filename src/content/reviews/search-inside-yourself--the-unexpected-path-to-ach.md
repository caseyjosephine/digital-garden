Meditation has turned into somewhat of a sexy practice these days, especially among techie types. Case in point: this book about meditation, written by the person in charge of meditation at Google. However, this is not some business book about increased productivity. Indeed, Chade-Meng Tan’s goal in life is to change the world through increased personal contentment and compassion.<br/><br/>I started practicing meditation before I actually knew what meditation was, although I certainly wouldn’t consider myself even close to being an expert. As a kid, I had guided meditation tapes (why I had them, I have no idea), and my mom taught me how to chant ohm when we got stressed out looking for parking (can you tell I grew up in Southern California?).<br/><br/>But, like many others, I didn’t really get into meditation until I started doing yoga. At the beginning, I wasn’t exactly putting in the best effort towards meditating during shavasana, but then I experienced something magical. During a yoga class in college, my instructor asked us to imagine a white ball of energy inside the chest. She guided us in mentally moving the ball of energy around ourselves, allowing us to focus on each part in turn. I felt surprisingly energized afterwards. I wanted to learn more about meditation.<br/><br/>After my first real experience with meditation, I started doing it with more frequency, but relatively timidly. I practiced the breathing exercises I’d learned to help myself go to sleep. I used meditation to stop being annoyed by traffic. I practiced breathing in positive energy and letting the negativity leave my body. Many, many years later I’ve been making a point to deepen my practice, planning time for it so that I don’t stop doing it when I need it most. Unsurprisingly, I’ve been reading as much as I can about it as well.<br/><br/>This book is filled with great information and meditation exercises, the same ones used in the Search Inside Yourself course at Google. Some of my favorites are the loving kindness meditation (trying to remember that Donald Trump is also a human that desires happiness is really quite difficult) and the empathic listening exercises. Search Inside Yourself is definitely a great toolbox for anyone interested in meditation.
