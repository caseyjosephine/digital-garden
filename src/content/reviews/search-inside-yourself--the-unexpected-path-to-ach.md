My Review: 'Meditation has turned into somewhat of a sexy practice these days, especially
  among techie types. Case in point: this book about meditation, written by the person
  in charge of meditation at Google. However, this is not some business book about
  increased productivity. Indeed, Chade-Meng Tan’s goal in life is to change the world
  through increased personal contentment and compassion.<br/><br/>I started practicing
  meditation before I actually knew what meditation was, although I certainly wouldn’t
  consider myself even close to being an expert. As a kid, I had guided meditation
  tapes (why I had them, I have no idea), and my mom taught me how to chant ohm when
  we got stressed out looking for parking (can you tell I grew up in Southern California?).<br/><br/>But,
  like many others, I didn’t really get into meditation until I started doing yoga.
  At the beginning, I wasn’t exactly putting in the best effort towards meditating
  during shavasana, but then I experienced something magical. During a yoga class
  in college, my instructor asked us to imagine a white ball of energy inside the
  chest. She guided us in mentally moving the ball of energy around ourselves, allowing
  us to focus on each part in turn. I felt surprisingly energized afterwards. I wanted
  to learn more about meditation.<br/><br/>After my first real experience with meditation,
  I started doing it with more frequency, but relatively timidly. I practiced the
  breathing exercises I’d learned to help myself go to sleep. I used meditation to
  stop being annoyed by traffic. I practiced breathing in positive energy and letting
  the negativity leave my body. Many, many years later I’ve been making a point to
  deepen my practice, planning time for it so that I don’t stop doing it when I need
  it most. Unsurprisingly, I’ve been reading as much as I can about it as well.<br/><br/>This
  book is filled with great information and meditation exercises, the same ones used
  in the Search Inside Yourself course at Google. Some of my favorites are the loving
  kindness meditation (trying to remember that Donald Trump is also a human that desires
  happiness is really quite difficult) and the empathic listening exercises. Search
  Inside Yourself is definitely a great toolbox for anyone interested in meditation.'
