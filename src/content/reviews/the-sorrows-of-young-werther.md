My Review: 'I couldn''t help but imagine young Werther as a high school, tweeting
  about all his troubles to the ether. So, without further ado, I present to you:
  The Tweets of Young Werther.<br/><br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cadUOSf.jpg"
  title="Hosted by imgur.com" /><br/><br/>This is the kind of book that high school
  teachers should be making self-absorbed teenagers read. They can totally relate,
  both to the intense feelings of emotion and the complete conviction that no one
  in the world has ever felt the same way before. I couldn''t relate that well, because
  really Werther just needs to man up and bang someone else, but I still (inexplicably)
  liked this book. Actually, my affection is explicable: we''re talking about Goethe,
  after all.<br/><br/>I should really step away from photoshop and get back to work.'
