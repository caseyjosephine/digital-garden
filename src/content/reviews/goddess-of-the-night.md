Apparently today is the day wherein I go back in time and review books of my youth. One of my friends was obsessed with this series in high school, and forced me to read this drivel. I mostly remembered that this book made me want to have my own magical powers, so that I could transfigure the book into a sharp object and gouge out my eyes in some sort of tragic, Oedipal act. Because even at 15, I was already a snobby asshole who had read the entire [b:Oedipus Cycle|1540|The Oedipus Cycle  Oedipus Rex / Oedipus at Colonus / Antigone|Sophocles|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1328876438s/1540.jpg|5672] and knew that most paranormal young adult fiction was worthless.
