My Review: 'How to write a book about the space program that''s far less compelling
  than the one Tom Wolfe wrote on the same subject, in five easy steps.<br/><br/>1)
  First, make sure to eliminate everything that''s interesting about space, and the
  politics involved in exploring it. The space race was an insane endeavor. Astronauts
  faced death when they got in those capsules; some of them actually died. Americans
  became obsessed with nationalist astro-gazing, but in the background buzzed the
  constant (and not unsubstantiated) fear that Russia would blow us the fuck up. Ignore
  all of that. Instead, focus on people''s hair.<br/><br/>2) Second, write like a
  middling high school sophomore. It''s best if you channel said sophomore as if he
  had gotten spectacularly high and only then remembered he had to write something
  (imagine that, by this point, he''s three bowls in and not having an easy time getting
  his neurons to fire appropriately).<br/><br/>3) Organization, schmorganization.
  Ramble about whatever comes to mind!<br/><br/>4) Provide no information on the historical
  context, except to mention that, by the first Mercury launch, pink lipstick was
  out and red lipstick was in.<br/><br/>5) Don''t attempt to humanize your subjects
  by providing well-researched biographical information. Instead, just find out what
  they were wearing at the time. That''s much easier.<br/><br/>This is nonfiction
  for the kind of workaday philistines who get their book recommendations from People
  magazine. The Astronaut Wive''s Club is sure to please that demographic: it has
  a pretty cover, and is a great choice for the type of person who spends their evenings
  watching The Real Housewives of Orange County while writing inane Facebook posts
  in which they bemoan their perceived lack of reading time.<br/><br/>In other words,
  I recommend this book only for those who have no intention of reading it.'
