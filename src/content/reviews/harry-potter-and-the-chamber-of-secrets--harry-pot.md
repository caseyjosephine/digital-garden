My 2014 reread of Harry Potter continues with the second book in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Again, I don’t think it will be particularly effective for me to actually attempt to review the book, both because almost everyone has read it, and I’m far too biased anyway. So, as with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, I’ll just type until I feel done typing, and the consider that my review.<br/><br/>The Chamber of Secrets has never been my favorite Harry Potter book: in fact, it became my least favorite when there were only two books in the series, and remained in last place throughout. It’s not that it’s not good, though. As an unabashed fan of Potter, I’m still of the opinion that a “bad” Harry Potter book is still pretty great. Still, CoS has quite a few things that annoy me: Dobby, Hermione’s longish absence, Harry’s exasperating ennui about not being enough of a Gryffindor, and spiders. I hate spiders.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, I didn’t get too annoyed by those things this time around. Maybe I’m becoming too nostalgic for my own good, or Dobby is less obnoxious than I thought he was. Regardless, I enjoyed this reread more than expected. I’m also happy that I’ve finished rereading the more juvenile first two books, and I’m now ready for the (much meatier) Prisoner of Azkaban.
