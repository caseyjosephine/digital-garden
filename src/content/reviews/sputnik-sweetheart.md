My Review: 'Reading Murakami is a lot like visiting your home town after many years
  away. There''s a sense of uncanny familiarity to the whole thing. You navigate the
  streets on instinct, your eyes drawn to the buildings and businesses that weren''t
  there before. Part of you becomes irrationally upset that the current residents
  would do such a thing without consulting you. Another part of you berates yourself
  for engaging in nostalgia-driven solipsism.<br/><br/>If you find yourself stopping
  at the liquor store to check whether they''ve started carrying Cutty Sark, or gazing
  at the sky to make sure there''s only one moon, then you''re in  Murakami territory.<br/><br/>Sputnik
  Sweetheart is a love story. Kind of. It''s also a mystery. Sort of. Murakami ticks
  many of the boxes he usually ticks: quotidian narrator, ordinary girl unknowingly
  turned extraordinary ingenue, classical music, cats. However, this particular book
  is different from the others, at times a little more raw, at other times a little
  more restrained. There''s a lyrical quality that I previously associated with his
  short stories, a Nabokovesque elegance that reminds me why I count Murakami among
  my favorite writers.<br/><br/>This review is somewhat useless, isn''t it? But isn''t
  art? I haven''t really told you anything useful about the book, really, but I think
  I''ve told you all you need to know.'
