My Review: Gillian Flynn is tricky. She makes you think you know what's going on,
  that you've completely figured out the ending of the book. Then she tricks you.
  Right when you're thinking, "oh, I see what you did there, but you can't fool me
  twice" she tricks you again. Because she's tricky.<br/><br/>I don't now how effectively
  I can review this book, because I want to let her trick you. Sharp Objects focuses
  on a reporter with a dark past who travels from Chicago to her hometown in Missouri
  to break a story about a serial killer. It's one of those books that you can't put
  down (I'm being almost literal about that. I definitely walked from the train to
  my lab without putting down my kindle because I couldn't stop reading. If my mom
  had seen that, she would have reminded me that crossing busy intersections while
  reading a book is dangerous).<br/><br/>After reading both Sharp Objects and Flynn's
  well-regarded [b:Gone Girl|8442457|Gone Girl|Gillian Flynn|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1339602131s/8442457.jpg|13306276],
  I've got to say that Flynn is a writer to keep an eye on. She may not be a particularly
  stylish writer, but her books are well paced and masterfully plotted. Plus, she's
  not afraid to create unlikable characters, which in my mind is a great thing.
