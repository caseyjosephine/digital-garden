My Review: 'This collection is hit or miss, but when it hits it hits hard. <br/><br/>Bangers
  include:<br/><br/>- Gray Matter<br/>- The Ledge<br/>- I Know What You Need<br/>-
  Sometimes They Come Back<br/>- I Am the Doorway<br/>- Trucks<br/>- Quitters, Inc.<br/><br/>I''ve
  been a fan of King for a long time, and I''ve always considered him to be a character-and-concept
  author who lets plot come along for the ride. That''s not a knock at King—I read
  him for the characters and concepts. The character moments do shine here, particularly
  in I Know What You Need and Gray Matter (my highlight of the collection). And the
  concepts are, as always, top notch. <br/><br/>What impressed me most about this
  collection of short stories is that King is a master at creating tension and amplifying
  the stakes. The absurdly campy story Trucks had no right to be as tense as it was.
  And I have to admit that I kept putting down my book during The Ledge, because my
  entire body started tensing up. <br/><br/>I am now vaguely afraid of truck stops
  and pigeons. Thanks, Steve. '
