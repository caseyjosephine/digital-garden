This collection is hit or miss, but when it hits it hits hard. <br/><br/>Bangers include:<br/><br/>- Gray Matter<br/>- The Ledge<br/>- I Know What You Need<br/>- Sometimes They Come Back<br/>- I Am the Doorway<br/>- Trucks<br/>- Quitters, Inc.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of King for a long time, and I've always considered him to be a character-and-concept author who lets plot come along for the ride. That's not a knock at Kingâ€”I read him for the characters and concepts. The character moments do shine here, particularly in I Know What You Need and Gray Matter (my highlight of the collection). And the concepts are, as always, top notch. <br/><br/>What impressed me most about this collection of short stories is that King is a master at creating tension and amplifying the stakes. The absurdly campy story Trucks had no right to be as tense as it was. And I have to admit that I kept putting down my book during The Ledge, because my entire body started tensing up. <br/><br/>I am now vaguely afraid of truck stops and pigeons. Thanks, Steve.
