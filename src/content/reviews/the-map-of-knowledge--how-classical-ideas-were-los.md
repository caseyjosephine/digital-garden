My Review: 'When I was first taught about the Renaissance, it was a simple story of
  lost and found. We (and by we I mean Western Civilization, the implied default)
  had knowledge in antiquity. The Middle Ages came, and we lost that knowledge. Then
  the Renaissance happened because we found it all again. <br/><br/>Many historical
  accounts of the fall of Rome and the early Middle Ages focus on how (and whether)
  we lost our knowledge. In contrast, The Map of Knowledge chronicles the people who
  preserved our knowledge for long enough that it could be found again. <br/><br/>Violet
  Moller tells this story through the lens of three scholars: Euclid, Ptolemy, and
  Galen. She explores cities that became centers of learning, many of which have been
  glossed over by Western historical accounts because they were part of the Islamic
  world. <br/><br/>The Map of Knowledge is a quick read that will appeal to those
  interested in scholarship and academic cultures. My only complaint is that it was
  too short.'
