My Review: 'Remember when Lana Del Ray came out with Video Games as a single and we
  all got super excited because it seemed like the harbinger of good things to come?
  And then she came out with an LP and we were all like, yeah, no. <br/><br/>Also,
  remember when The Hangover came out, and it was a seriously excellent and hilarious
  movie, self-contained and in no need of a sequel? Which means, of course, an unnecessary
  sequel came out a few years later and it sucked and we all rolled our eyes.<br/><br/>In
  the grand tradition of taking a good thing and screwing it up completely, Where
  She Went takes a good thing and screws it up completely. <br/><br/>Where She Went
  is what happens when you  take something that was polished, finished, and overall
  pretty good, and try to milk it for all it is worth. If I Stay was one of the rare
  young adult novels that didn’t suck: it was good <i>for Young Adult Fiction</i>
  (ah, that fun little qualifier), and would have been an interesting if decidedly
  mediocre offering had it been marketed towards adults. Though it was sometimes maudlin,
  at points it made me feel some actual emotion. I didn’t hate it and, coming from
  me, that’s not faint praise.<br/><br/>The best thing about If I Stay was the ending,
  which succeeded in its ambiguity. One of my major issues with Young Adult novels
  is that they tell the reader what to think, and I liked that If I Stay invited the
  reader to think for themselves. Where She Went removes the ambiguity and throws
  the thoughtfulness out the window. Instead of dealing with themes of loss and grief,
  it turns into a celebrity-ridden wish fulfillment fantasy. Unlike the first book,
  which could easily be enjoyed by adults, this is firmly targeted at the tween crowd.<br/><br/>My
  advice to those who liked the first book: stay away from this one. It’s really not
  worth your time.'
