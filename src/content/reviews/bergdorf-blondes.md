My Review: While admittedly shallow, predictable and completely devoid of any literary
  merit, [b:Bergdorf Blondes|381704|Bergdorf Blondes|Plum Sykes|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1174332033s/381704.jpg|98]
  is a fun and fast read. The narrator is one of the New York "it" girls, who spends
  most of her time going to parties, meeting up with guys, and getting highlights.
  <br/><br/>Plum Sykes' ability to poke fun at high society, while still making your
  wish you were in on the action, makes this a great beach read.
