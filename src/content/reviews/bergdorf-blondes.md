While admittedly shallow, predictable and completely devoid of any literary merit, [b:Bergdorf Blondes|381704|Bergdorf Blondes|Plum Sykes|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1174332033s/381704.jpg|98] is a fun and fast read. The narrator is one of the New York "it" girls, who spends most of her time going to parties, meeting up with guys, and getting highlights. <br/><br/>Plum Sykes' ability to poke fun at high society, while still making your wish you were in on the action, makes this a great beach read.
