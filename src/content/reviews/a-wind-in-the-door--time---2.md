My Review: 'Fantastic creatures, exciting adventures and biological science combine
  to make A Wind in the Door a great read, even after childhood. While not as good
  as the fantastic "A Wrinkle in Time," this book kept me on the edge of my seat as
  a child, and still held up when I read it later as an adult. '
