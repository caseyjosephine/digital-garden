My Review: 'When I was young, I had a children''s encyclopedia set. The math book
  was my favorite: it contained puzzles, interesting problems, and, most importantly,
  an excerpt from The Phantom Tollbooth. That was my first introduction to this wonderful
  book. <br/><br/>The thing I remember most about the book is the "battle" between
  math and english, which really resonated for some reason. Like Lewis Carroll''s
  masterful "Alice''s Adventures in Wonderland," "The Phantom Tollbooth" is populated
  with memorable characters, amusing satire and a greatly imaginative plot. I would
  recommend it, not just to children, but to anyone who loves a good story.'
