My Review: '3.5 stars: File this under neither particularly good nor bad, but worth
  it because it’s just a hell of a lot of fun to read. Rachel is an alcoholic divorcee
  whose ex-husband left her for his pregnant mistress. She’s got issues. After she
  gets fired from her job, she continues to take the commuter train into London every
  day. One day, while on the train (drunk, perhaps unable to trust her senses) she
  sees something. And that, well, that changes everything.<br/><br/>What more is there
  to say about the book? Not too much: this falls firmly into the “intelligent brain
  candy but definitely not literary fiction” category. Still, if you want to spend
  a pretty enjoyable evening tearing through a novel trying to figure out what happened
  (and whether you called it <spoiler>I didn’t</spoiler>), The Girl on the Train won’t
  let you down.'
