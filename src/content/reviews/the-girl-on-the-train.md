3.5 stars: File this under neither particularly good nor bad, but worth it because it’s just a hell of a lot of fun to read. Rachel is an alcoholic divorcee whose ex-husband left her for his pregnant mistress. She’s got issues. After she gets fired from her job, she continues to take the commuter train into London every day. One day, while on the train (drunk, perhaps unable to trust her senses) she sees something. And that, well, that changes everything.<br/><br/>What more is there to say about the book? Not too much: this falls firmly into the “intelligent brain candy but definitely not literary fiction” category. Still, if you want to spend a pretty enjoyable evening tearing through a novel trying to figure out what happened (and whether you called it <spoiler>I didn’t</spoiler>), The Girl on the Train won’t let you down.
