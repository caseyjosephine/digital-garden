I've been skating for as long as I can remember, and, while I lost my double axel sometime in the early 2000's (double axel, you are a demon mistress, but maybe I'll get you back one of these days), I never lost my love for the sport. Growing up in the skating world, during the height of skating's popularity in the U.S., I was fortunate enough to see (and, occasionally, skate with) some incredibly talented skaters. I mean, have you ever watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B_pCDjmc04">Michelle Kwan perform an artistic program dressed like a Disney princess?</a> You can imagine how much 12 year old me totally geeked out about that.<br/><br/>Anyway, Dick Button is a legend: he's pretty much the voice of figuring skating. And, while he can be opinionated, he obviously cares deeply about skating. This book seems cobbled together, which is too bad: as others have mentioned, it could use a ghostwriter or at least a better edit. But, once you get past that, it's pretty fun.<br/><br/>One of the major things Dick Button has been vocal about is the need to maintain the artistry of figure skating. He talks about legendary performances, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57R7aAY5QiM#aid=P-9wJ15xT5s">Katarina Witt's long program at the 88 olympics at Calgary</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc-0BCSyWtc">Torvill and Dean's dance to Bolero in 84</a>; these types of performances wouldn't fly amongst the technique-rich but artistry-poor programs we see today. And I agree that that's a bad thing. There's a reason why people got so up in arms about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt7vHlLcrKg">Adelina Sotnikova's gold medal performance in 2014</a>: while it was technically demanding, I (and others) felt it lacked in artistry.

Ain't nobody understand that shit, which is why you shouldn't put a speed skater in charge of the ISU.)<br/><br/>I'm firmly within the niche for this book and, while I found it fun, I wouldn't recommend it for a general audience (I'm still waiting on a book that gives a cultural history of the sport, a la [b:Apollo's Angels: A History of Ballet|8268599|Apollo's Angels  A History of Ballet|Jennifer Homans|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1347374575s/8268599.jpg|13116700]). Still, skaters, former skaters, and skating parents will probably enjoy this romp through the skating world.<br/><br/>If you do read this, make sure to read it with a tab open to YouTube: trust me, you're going to want to watch some of these performances!
