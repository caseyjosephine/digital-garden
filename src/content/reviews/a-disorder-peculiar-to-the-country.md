My Review: 'I am surprised to read all the negative reviews of this book, and therefore
  feel that I should offer my opinion. When I picked up this book, I thought it would
  be much more comedic, and I was happy to find that it really had something to say.
  As others have said, the protagonists aren''t likable. They are selfish and manipulative,
  and their relationship only gets more hilariously depressing throughout the course
  of the novel. 9/11 plays an interesting stylistic role in the novel: the two protagonists
  take this world event, and center it around themselves. <br/><br/>I found this book
  to offer an interesting, although bleak, point of view on marriage in American culture,
  and would recommend it to anyone who isn''t afraid of poking fun at the ridiculous
  things we do in the name of personal gain.'
