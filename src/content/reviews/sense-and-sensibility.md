I always felt ashamed of not having read Sense and Sensibility: it seemed as egregious a cultural oversight as not having seen The Godfather or not having listened to The White Album. However, my shame never induced me to actually read the book. Of all of Austen’s work, Sense and Sensibility is the most straightforward marriage plot, and while I admire the charm involved I typically prefer my literature more scathing. Additionally, I can only roll my eyes when Austen’s heroines bemoan the idea of being an unmarried woman of seven and twenty, especially as I recently turned 28.<br/><br/>Sometimes, though, we’re drawn to a particular book not by inclination, but by situation. And, while I cannot yet write coherently about the more difficult events happening around me, I can say that a regency era comedy of manners is as far away from my current situation as I’m likely to get.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I loved Sense and Sensibility, despite my reservations. As the title suggests, it follows the story of two different sisters: Elinor, who is ruled by sense, and Marianne, who is guided by sensibility. The novel opens with their father’s death, which means that their family home will go to their half-brother and his greedy wife. In order to return to their old lifestyle, they need to marry well.<br/><br/>I should note here that part of what makes Austen seem so relevant in the 21st century, when women have many opportunities beyond marrying well, is that she allows herself to be blunt in describing the cultural mores of the 18th century, when a fortuitous marriage was the best that could be expected.<br/><br/>Sense and Sensibility has earned itself a place on my “read it again soon” list: it’s escapist while still being smart, and as charming as it is socially conscious.
