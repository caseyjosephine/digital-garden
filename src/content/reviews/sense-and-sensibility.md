My Review: 'I always felt ashamed of not having read Sense and Sensibility: it seemed
  as egregious a cultural oversight as not having seen The Godfather or not having
  listened to The White Album. However, my shame never induced me to actually read
  the book. Of all of Austen’s work, Sense and Sensibility is the most straightforward
  marriage plot, and while I admire the charm involved I typically prefer my literature
  more scathing. Additionally, I can only roll my eyes when Austen’s heroines bemoan
  the idea of being an unmarried woman of seven and twenty, especially as I recently
  turned 28.<br/><br/>Sometimes, though, we’re drawn to a particular book not by inclination,
  but by situation. And, while I cannot yet write coherently about the more difficult
  events happening around me, I can say that a regency era comedy of manners is as
  far away from my current situation as I’m likely to get.<br/><br/>I have to admit
  that I loved Sense and Sensibility, despite my reservations. As the title suggests,
  it follows the story of two different sisters: Elinor, who is ruled by sense, and
  Marianne, who is guided by sensibility. The novel opens with their father’s death,
  which means that their family home will go to their half-brother and his greedy
  wife. In order to return to their old lifestyle, they need to marry well.<br/><br/>I
  should note here that part of what makes Austen seem so relevant in the 21st century,
  when women have many opportunities beyond marrying well, is that she allows herself
  to be blunt in describing the cultural mores of the 18th century, when a fortuitous
  marriage was the best that could be expected.<br/><br/>Sense and Sensibility has
  earned itself a place on my “read it again soon” list: it’s escapist while still
  being smart, and as charming as it is socially conscious. '
