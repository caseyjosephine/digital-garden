I was assigned this book more than once in high school, and more than once in college. I never read it. Sorry English teachers/professors. I'm not sure why I didn't read it, as I love Apocalypse Now. I just didn't.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm kicking myself, because I read it in one sitting, and it was awesome. Evocative and meandering, it truly paints a portrait of a journey.
