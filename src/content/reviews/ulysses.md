My Review: '<b>Update 10/17/12</b>: Against my better judgement, I''m adding this
  to my "dear ones" shelf. I''m not sure why, exactly. At it''s best, Ulysses is intellectually
  exhausting; at worst, it is unambiguously opaque. The thing is, I think about Ulysses
  often, and when I least expect to. <br/><br/>I need to take some time before rating
  and reviewing this book. Reading Ulysses is an undertaking, and now that I''ve finished
  it I cannot articulate my reaction. Certainly, I had to push myself to finish reading
  this book, as the process often became infuriating. However, the lovely ephemeral
  moments of clarity somewhat justified Joyce''s general style of overwhelming obfuscation.
  At this point, I''m glad to have finished (and I want to drink a <s>glass</s> bottle
  of wine).'
