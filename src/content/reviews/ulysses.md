<b>Update 10/17/12</b>: Against my better judgement, I'm adding this to my "dear ones" shelf. I'm not sure why, exactly. At it's best, Ulysses is intellectually exhausting; at worst, it is unambiguously opaque. The thing is, I think about Ulysses often, and when I least expect to. <br/><br/>I need to take some time before rating and reviewing this book. Reading Ulysses is an undertaking, and now that I've finished it I cannot articulate my reaction. Certainly, I had to push myself to finish reading this book, as the process often became infuriating. However, the lovely ephemeral moments of clarity somewhat justified Joyce's general style of overwhelming obfuscation. At this point, I'm glad to have finished (and I want to drink a <s>glass</s> bottle of wine).
