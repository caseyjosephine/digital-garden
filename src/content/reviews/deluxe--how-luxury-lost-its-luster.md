My Review: 'So I had a 250 word anecdote about my own bespoke figure skating competition
  dresses all drafted for this review, before I remembered that Deluxe is not about
  the romance of luxury items. Instead, it examines how the world of haute couture
  has largely died, shifting from a niche market for elites to a homogenized market
  catering to a cadre of middle-class suburbanites who can''t tell the difference
  between coated canvas and crocodile. Author Dana Thomas thinks this is a bad thing.<br/><br/>I
  don''t know that I''m completely in agreement, but, as someone who finds fashion
  interesting both from a sociological and aesthetic perspective, I agree that the
  upper portion of industry faces some serious issues. Of major concern is the fact
  that luxury brands increasingly rely on selling perfume and handbags to aspirational
  middle class customers (it''s worth noting that I''m an aspirational middle class
  customer; most of my designer stuff has been gifted, thrifted, or bought on consignment).
  Anyway, this means the couture houses are taking huge economic risks, as dips in
  the economy usually see the middle class cutting back on luxury goods. This business
  model doesn''t exactly seem sustainable. <br/><br/>Beyond that, globalization has
  had a huge impact on luxury manufacturing. Although there are still luxury ateliers
  in Western Europe, they cater to an increasingly niche market. Like everyone else,
  luxury brands have largely outsourced their production to Asia. Donald Trump has
  promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US; realistically, that will not
  work in the garment industry. The prices we pay for clothing now have been artificially
  deflated by the extraordinarily low salaries (and poor working conditions) for overseas
  workers. Like it or not, clothing Made in the USA would be out of reach for most
  Americans. Plus, we don''t have the technology, nor do we have the infrastructure.
  As always, these issues are far more complicated than they''re made out to be.<br/><br/>Interestingly,
  this book was published in 2007, and read somewhat like an elegy for a bygone way
  of life. Conspicuous consumption may have been de rigueur in the early 2000s, but
  these days minimalism is chic and logos are gauche. Things sure have changed since
  the day I bought my Louis Vuitton Speedy 25. '
