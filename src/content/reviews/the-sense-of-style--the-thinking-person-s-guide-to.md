My Review: 'This book taught me that many students of English have learned incorrect
  language rules from their teachers, and their writing can be improved by unlearning
  them. Lucky for me, I went to a failing high school where I didn’t learn shit. This
  must be why my prose is so sparkly. <br/><br/>Steven Pinker possesses a great mind
  and admirable writing ability. Ironically, his writing is at its worst when he tries
  to pin down why it works. The deeper he gets into usage-based explications of linguistically-interesting
  constructions, the further away he gets from offering real advice to budding Hemingways.
  Realistically, there are two steps to improving your writing: read some fucking
  books, and write a lot. <br/><br/>Improving your writing is like improving your
  Spanish: you’re not going to logic your way into understanding the secrets of syntax,
  just like you’re not going to find a satisfying logical explanation for that pesky
  personal “a.” Instead, you have to tune your ear to what sounds right, and what
  sounds off. The main problem with Pinker’s style guide is that he tries to intellectualize
  something that has to be learned through experience. It’s like learning Spanish
  by memorizing the Wikipedia page on the Spanish language. It’s not going to work.
  <br/><br/>Ultimately, a writer has to get intimate with good prose, roll around
  in bed with it, be nakedly, uncomfortably vulnerable with it. Pinker won’t get you
  there. A writer should look to the great writers: Tolstoy, Joyce, Eliot, Proust.
  Their words make you want to grab their paragraphs, push their chapters against
  the wall, and ravish them.'
