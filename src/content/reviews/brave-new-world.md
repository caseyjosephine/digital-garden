The future is bleak, but, on the plus side, there are free drugs and casual sex for everyone.<br/><br/>This is an interesting book, but not as effective as [b:1984|5470|1984|George Orwell|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1328718447s/5470.jpg|153313]. It just didn't feel real to me. <spoiler>As terrifying as it would be to live in a world without Shakespeare, the constant references to "Our Ford" felt laughable.</spoiler> I think I'll read [b:We|76171|We |Yevgeny Zamyatin|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1321919581s/76171.jpg|2144026] at some point, as I except that one to be better. The idea of Brave New World is certainly interesting, I'm just not that happy about the execution here.
