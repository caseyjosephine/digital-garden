My Review: 'So yeah, this is a best selling book about zombies. It''s fun and actually
  somewhat decent, but only somewhat, so I''m morally obligated to give it three stars,
  no more, no less. Because, even though I''ve already said that I''m absolutely fickle
  with stars, I still think they should mean something.<br/><br/>Zombie apocalypse.
  It starts small, gets bigger, mass chaos ensues, humanity tries to figure out how
  to rebuild. You know the tropes: the real difficulty is in facing ourselves as the
  enemy and yada yada yada. The one thing that''s particularly effective is that World
  War Z is styled as an oral history. At first, I thought this would be annoying,
  but it ended up being surprisingly refreshing. The whole oral history thing allowed
  Max Brooks to tackle some of the political and philosophical issues implicit in
  said zombie apocalypse. That''s pretty cool.<br/><br/>I still have a hard time understanding
  how so many people are so interested in reading over-the-top fictionalized end of
  the world scenarios, while over in the real world a sizable proportion of people
  fail to recognize that we are actively and catastrophically destroying our environment,
  our climate, and the planet in general. So that''s something to think about. Too
  bad climate change isn''t as sexy as a zombie apocalypse.'
