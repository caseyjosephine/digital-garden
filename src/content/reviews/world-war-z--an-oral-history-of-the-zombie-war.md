So yeah, this is a best selling book about zombies. It's fun and actually somewhat decent, but only somewhat, so I'm morally obligated to give it three stars, no more, no less. Because, even though I've already said that I'm absolutely fickle with stars, I still think they should mean something.<br/><br/>Zombie apocalypse. It starts small, gets bigger, mass chaos ensues, humanity tries to figure out how to rebuild. You know the tropes: the real difficulty is in facing ourselves as the enemy and yada yada yada. The one thing that's particularly effective is that World War Z is styled as an oral history. At first, I thought this would be annoying, but it ended up being surprisingly refreshing. The whole oral history thing allowed Max Brooks to tackle some of the political and philosophical issues implicit in said zombie apocalypse. That's pretty cool.<br/><br/>I still have a hard time understanding how so many people are so interested in reading over-the-top fictionalized end of the world scenarios, while over in the real world a sizable proportion of people fail to recognize that we are actively and catastrophically destroying our environment, our climate, and the planet in general. So that's something to think about. Too bad climate change isn't as sexy as a zombie apocalypse.
