My Review: 'My weird obsession with Marie Antoinette started (as all weird obsessions
  do) in college. I can''t place it perfectly, but I''m pretty sure it was sometime
  after the Belle and Sebastian days and somewhat before I started watching French
  New Wave films. However, I''m definitely sure it was well before I read metaphysical
  poetry almost exclusively. Whenever it was, I got really into Marie Antoinette:
  I read biographies, watched the film over and over again, and even had an ill-fated
  desire to decorate my apartment like Versailles (note: this doesn''t work so well
  when you''ve got an entry-level job. Trust me.). <br/><br/>Anyway, I bought this
  during the Marie Antoinette phase and just never got around to reading it, which
  is too bad because it ended up being a well-written and well-researced work of historical
  fiction that I wish I would have read sooner. Yeah, you know how it ends (and, if
  you''re anything like me, you know the whole plot), but Sena Jeter Naslund does
  a good job of making you not care. The novel is narrated in the first person perspective,
  and a few times Toinette herself makes unknowing comments that allude to her eventual
  demise (note: this is what is meant by the word irony, or dramatic irony if you
  want to get pedantic. Just wanted to clarify, in case you still thought that irony
  means pretending you don''t like *Nsync. Because you know you do.).<br/><br/>The
  only somewhat awkward thing about this novel is that it has a few too many parallels
  with the Sofia Coppola film. They both came out at about the same time, so it''s
  hard for me to call shenanigans, but I''m still going to call it. But really, who
  cares. This was pure fun (except for the decapitation bit), and I would recommend
  it if you''re into this sort of thing.'

My weird obsession with Marie Antoinette started (as all weird obsessions do) in college.
