I lost two precious cats in the span of a year. It was a rough time. Also, we live in a society so it's been a rough time for everyone in general. <br/><br/>This book made me ugly cry. It was incredibly cozy, but I was not prepared for the emotions. <br/><br/>Don't be like me. Toss some Kleenex in your car, make sure you've got an extra jar of Carmex on hand. Then pick this book up, because these are the kind of emotions you need to feel right now.
