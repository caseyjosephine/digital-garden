Christopher is a teenage boy who suffers from Autism. Although he is highly functioning, especially when it comes to problems with concrete solutions (such as math and physics), he finds it hard to understand human behavior and motivations. He makes much deeper connections with animals, because he can understand what they are thinking. So when the neighbor's poodle is killed, Christopher becomes determined to find out who did it.<br/><br/>As Christopher searches for the answers, a powerful story about his past and the people connected to him unfolds. True to his condition, Christopher relates major personal events as if they were of little importance, and spends large amounts of time on logical reasoning and observation. Through the course of the novel, the reader begins to understand Christopher's family in a way he simply cannot.<br/><br/>The novel is both well researched and darkly funny. I found it to be a quick and thought-provoking read, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the fascinating world of autistic individuals.
