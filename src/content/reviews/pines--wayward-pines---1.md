My Review: 'I’m a big fan of the creepy small town trope. You know the one, where
  everything seems perfect on the surface, but things aren’t exactly what they seem
  (<a href=“http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936/“>related</a>). Part of my obsession
  likely stems from the fact that I grew up in a small town with two major industries:
  tourism, and meth. My family moved up there for the clean air and beautiful mountain
  views, and even though we’ve all moved away I still read the local news to see if
  anyone I know has gotten arrested or stabbed recently. <br/><br/>Anyway, Wayward
  Pines, ID, is a creepy small town that’s eerily reminiscent of Crestline, CA, except
  with 90% less meth and 100% more unexplained phenomena. I won’t explain what the
  unexplained phenomena are, because that would ruin the book. This is total brain
  candy, and mostly works because it keeps you wanting to know what’s happening. It’s
  appropriate for a beach or bathtub, which tells you a bit about how literary it
  is.<br/><br/><a href=“http://www.fox.com/wayward-pines/“>Fox is turning this book
  into a TV Show</a>, which I will likely watch and then complain about, because it’s
  not likely to be nearly as good as Twin Peaks. '
