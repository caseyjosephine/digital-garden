My Review: 'Ah, literary conjecture: mostly fanciful, ultimately untenable. Here''s
  the thing: theories are not interesting qua theories, as their utility lies in making
  specific, testable predictions. A theory that cannot be falsified is not a good
  theory (which is why research psychologists are much less interested in what Freud
  has to say than English professors are).<br/><br/>Anyway, this short introduction
  is helpful if you want to drop phrases like "intertextuality and discoures on gendering"
  at a cocktail party. Fair warning: you''ll sound like a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1AG87vNjms">pedantic
  asshat</a>.'
