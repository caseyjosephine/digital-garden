My Review: 'It''s easy to lament society''s increased obsession with mediocre dystopian
  love stories, such as [b:Divergent|13335037|Divergent (Divergent, #1)|Veronica Roth|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1328559506s/13335037.jpg|13155899]
  and whatever else kids (and people who are far too old to be kids) are reading these
  days. Sometimes, serious readers want to throw up their hands and completely lose
  faith in humanity. But do not go gentle into that good night, for John Green is
  writing meaningful books for kids (and people who are far too old to be kids), and
  in that there is hope.<br/><br/>What''s wonderful about Green is that he captures
  what it feels like to be a teenager, when everything feels, overwhelmingly, as if
  it''s happening <i>right now</i>, and the stakes feel so much higher than they have
  any right to. The beauty of being a teenager is that everything is either brand
  new or far off in the future, and that makes it easy to be hyper-present by default.
  The sadness, of course, is that teenagers aren''t as grown up as they want to be,
  a fact that no amount of dark eyeliner, body piercings, and shouting matches can
  change. <br/><br/>Looking for Alaska is set at a boarding high school in Alabama,
  and deals with many of the activities that teenagers have been known to engage in
  from time to time. There''s smoking, underage drinking, prank-playing, and sex,
  which may make some puritanical parents keep their kids from reading it (probably
  in favor of emotionally abuse sparkly vampire fiction, because that doesn''t do
  anything crazy like question patriarchy). John Green takes his characters seriously,
  but doesn''t act as if they''re just younger adults. One particularly effective
  aspect of his writing is that his characters are at once precocious and sophomoric;
  this adult reader both remembered feeling the way they felt, and realized that they
  had such strong feelings and impulses because they haven''t really developed into
  full-fledged people yet. <br/><br/>I loved [b:The Fault in Our Stars|11870085|The
  Fault in Our Stars|John Green|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1360206420s/11870085.jpg|16827462],
  and I think I''ll continue to pick up Green''s books when I''m in the mood for a
  quick but emotionally-weighty read. While sparkly vampires will likely only appeal
  to the Abercrombie-aged crowd (do kids still wear that, or is there some new aspirational
  brand that kids are into these days? Would my point be better made if I mentioned
  Snapchat? Also, can someone please explain what Snapchat is?), stories that deal
  with what it means to be human are truly appropriate for all ages.<br/><br/>(Kids,
  if you''re reading this, do yourself a favor and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground_%26_Nico">listen
  to this over and over and over again until you''re sick of it, which you never ever
  will be because no one gets sick of The Velvet Underground</a>. Note: The Velvet
  Underground was brilliant, but Nico annoyed the shit out of everyone, so remember
  not to say too many nice things about Nico. Then, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trout_Mask_Replica">pick
  up Trout Mask Replica</a>, on vinyl if you can. Warning: your parents might wonder
  if you''re on drugs, but it''s worth it. You can thank me later.)'
