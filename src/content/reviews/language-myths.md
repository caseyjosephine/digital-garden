My Review: We all have some "common sense" thoughts about language, such as believing
  that some languages are harder than others, or that it's best for society if we
  keep people from "speaking incorrectly." Language Myths examines these erroneous
  assumptions in a series of articles revolving around one myth.<br/><br/>This book
  is a great introduction to linguistics, and may well lead readers to explore interesting
  concepts in more depth. Because I come from a cognitive background, I enjoyed the
  points of view offered, and would recommend this book to anyone interesting in language
  and linguistics.
