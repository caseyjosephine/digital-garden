We all have some "common sense" thoughts about language, such as believing that some languages are harder than others, or that it's best for society if we keep people from "speaking incorrectly." Language Myths examines these erroneous assumptions in a series of articles revolving around one myth.<br/><br/>This book is a great introduction to linguistics, and may well lead readers to explore interesting concepts in more depth. Because I come from a cognitive background, I enjoyed the points of view offered, and would recommend this book to anyone interesting in language and linguistics.
