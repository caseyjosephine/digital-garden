I'm going to have a difficult time explaining what "On Immunity" is about. This is a nonfiction book about vaccination, but, while it's well-researched, it isn't popular science. It's a book about a new mother's desire to protect her son, but it isn't a memoir. I've found Eula Biss's layered, lyrical style difficult to pin down in the past, and this book hasn't made it any easier.<br/><br/>As a writer, I find Biss's style inspiring. I'm impressed by how seamlessly she blends personal narrative with academic conjecture, and how consistently she maintains her tone while jumping between these extremes. I do plan on blatantly stealing some of her stylistic techniques, which is pretty high praise.<br/><br/>On the downside, Biss's meandering style sometimes feels sluggish and disjointed. Biss's does not commit herself to a particular structure, which allows her to jump back and forth in time while switching between different vignettes and topics. While this affords great creative freedom, I wish Biss had used a minimalist narrative structure to anchor the book (as she does in The Pain Scale). At the least, I feel she could have done a better job differentiating each section, as some come across as rehashes of others.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws (and the despite the fact that I still don't know what the book is about, even though I thought the process of writing this review would clarify that for me), "On Immunity" was certainly one of my favorite reads of 2016 and deserving of five stars.
