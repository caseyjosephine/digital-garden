My Review: I read an excerpt from The Lovely Bones in a magazine and was taken in
  immediately. By the time I found the book I couldn't get my hands off it. The story
  chronicles the after-life of 14 year old Susie, who was brutally murdered on her
  way home from school. Susie stays an eternal child while she watches all the people
  she loved grow up and move on with their lives. <br/><br/>Susie is a touchingly
  honest narrator, who explains in detail things no one should have to deal with.
  The heaven that Sebold creates is stunningly original, a place that you would want
  to visit under different circumstances. The voice of the novel, combined with the
  uniqueness of the plot, makes The Lovely Bones a story that shouldn't be passed
  up.
