My Review: 'I pre-ordered the audiobook, read by Jenna Lamia, who did an excellent
  job with [b:The Help|4667024|The Help|Kathryn Stockett|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1346100365s/4667024.jpg|4717423].
  Can''t wait to listen to it!<br/><br/>Edit: A fantastic novel, which is fair to
  Zelda without apologizing for her. Almost equally interesting is the portrait of
  Hemingway, who doesn''t come across well. Watching Scott sink further into alcoholism,
  with ever more frequent breaks from writing, was devastating. '
