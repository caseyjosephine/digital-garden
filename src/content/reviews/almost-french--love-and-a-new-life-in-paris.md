Although I've been to Paris, studied the French language and read more books on the French Revolution than a sane person should, I've always felt that I don't know much about French culture. Almost French has changed that for me. <br/><br/>After living in France for six years, Sarah Turnbull is an insider; and she takes readers inside French locations that tourists only dream of seeing. But at the same time, Turnbull remains unrelentingly Anglo-Saxon. Because of this, she is able to point out eccentricities of French life that native Parisians take for granted.<br/><br/>Overall, Almost French is a well written and engrossing read that exposes the life of a woman who is no longer living in Australia, but who is also not completely French.
