Over the years, Dan Brown has become one of my favorite guilty pleasure authors, and Angels and Demons represents his best work. The novel introduces Robert Langdon (of DaVinci Code fame), who must race through Rome attempting to save the most elite catholic cardinals from almost certain death.<br/><br/>The book is immediately gripping, and Brown showcases his talent for carrying the suspense to the very end. More interesting than the exotic locale is the way Brown depicts the church. Angels and Demons may not be brilliantly spun prose, but it really is the best of its genre, and well worth a read.
