Yeah, so I've read this. At least, I'm pretty sure I read most of it. I definitely didn't skip reading this in comparative lit and watch Troy instead, which is what my roommate did. I didn't think of that. I probably missed out on some killer keg stands.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is staying on my to-read list until I read the Fagles translation, which is supposed to be fantastic.
