The Lions of Al-Rassan invites the reader to read slowly, at least at first. We're dropped into the story <i>in media res</i>, and the politics are complicated. The book is set in an analogue of Moorish Spain, complete with three warring factions who practice three different religions. Guy Gavriel Kay doesn't rely on exposition, which makes the world feel fully-realized, if also, admittedly, somewhat confusing.<br/><br/>Still, Kay has a gift with creating characters that seem to emerge, like Athena, from his head fully-formed. There's a huge amount of humanity in this book. It's a refreshing change, especially in a genre like fantasy that often treats characterization as secondary to world-building.<br/><br/>Speaking of genre, I really hesitate to plunk this square in the fantasy genre. Sure, there are two moons, and a very minimal amount of magic, but it reads more like alternate-universe historical fiction. Readers who like the weirdness of China Mi√®ville and the grit of George R.R. Martin will feel right at home here.<br/><br/>I said this is a book that invites the reader to read slowly, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the pace ramped up significantly during the final third. Not that the pace was languid before, but I got that frenetic "the hand and this book have become magnets and I can't put the damn thing down" feeling. <br/><br/>The Lions of Al-Rassan is a different book, and sometimes a difficult book, and I don't think I could proffer a blanket recommendation here. But if you enjoy politics, and character-driven narratives, and moral grey areas, and if you're okay with a little bit of magical realism, I would definitely suggest giving it a shot.
