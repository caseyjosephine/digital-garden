My Review: 'I live dangerously close to Lagunitas. It''s pretty easy to head up to
  Petaluma after work, grab a beer tasting and a huge pretzel, fill up a growler of
  whatever I liked the most, then bring that baby home on a short, lovely drive through
  vineyards. A lot of my friends live dangerously close as well, and the beer sanctuary
  has live music and lots of picnic tables and everyone is super friendly. An early
  afternoon visit can turn into a late night pretty easily there. You''ve been warned.<br/><br/>Of
  course, I also live dangerously close to Fieldwork, Russian River, Racer 5, Marin
  Brewing, and a number of local spots I don''t want to name drop because I don''t
  want you creepers driving around the Bay Area trying to find me. It''s a pretty
  good life.<br/><br/>This is the story of Lagunitas, and it''s pretty interesting
  if you enjoy geeking out about adult beverages (which I do, that''s one of my very
  favorite activities). Everything''s in here: creating the recipe for the IPA, moving
  from West Marin to Petaluma, coming up with the copy on the labels, opening the
  sanctuary and starting the brewery in Chicago. And, in case you were wondering,
  the undercover investigation shutdown is well documented, and (as you would expect)
  not that exciting, because the fact that people in Northern California smoke weed
  is not exactly brand new information.<br/><br/>That said, this might be hard to
  follow for a casual reader who''s only nominally interested in craft beer. Magee
  assumes some level of background knowledge, and a reader who doesn''t know about
  the systemic issues around growth and distribution of craft beer in the US during
  the first waves of the scene will not understand how real the struggle was. Magee
  alludes to the fact that growth was a double-edged sword, but he''s humble enough
  to downplay it. It is important to know, though, that breweries would often grow
  too rapidly, but would still be unable to obtain bank funding to manage that growth,
  leading to a lot of closed breweries. If you''re interested in those sorts of issues,
