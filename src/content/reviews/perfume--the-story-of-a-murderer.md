My Review: 'Perfume has the potential to be awesomely bad. Consider the plot: dude
  has preternatural sense of smell and goes on a killing spree in an attempt to create
  the perfect perfume. People are onto him, and can tell that he’s evil, because he
  doesn’t have any body odor at all. In other words,<br/><br/><img src="http://www.caseyjosephine.com/images/gifs/wtf.gif"><br/><br/>However,
  it’s also on the list of 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, so I figured I’d
  give it a shot.<br/><br/>Tangentially related: I don’t pay too much attention to
  scents, at least not most of the time. I mean, put a glass of wine in front of me
  and, like any good oenophile, I’ll easily be able to tell you if it’s overoaked
  and I’ll pick out berry or citrus or stone fruit notes, and I might even be able
  to guess where it’s from, but that happens when I’m actively trying. In my workaday
  life, scent means little to me.<br/><br/>For a book with such a strange concept,
  Perfume is surprisingly gripping. Grenouille, the main character, is a particularly
  effective anti-hero. He’s creepily inconspicuous: he passes through his world mostly
  unseen, and commits his crimes with little notice. He’s not one of those anti-heroes
  that the reader roots for, either: as I read this book, I felt as if I were watching
  a snake from behind glass, feeding on some unassuming (and probably cute and cuddly)
  prey. The books makes you disgusted, but unable to turn away.<br/><br/>I felt that
  I should dislike this book: it’s strange, it’s creepy, it’s far outside of my comfort
  zone. If you’ve seen American Hustle, you likely remember Jennifer Lawrence’s character
  saying “Well, he must like it on some level. He must want it, because he keeps coming
  back for it. It''s like that perfume that you love, that you can''t stop smelling
  even when there''s something sour in it. Can''t get enough of it.”<br/><br/>Which,
  I think, is also a good way to sum up this book.'
