My Review: 'So Gaiman''s writing sometimes grates on me. He overuses adverbs, the
  pacing is uneven, and his characters, while not completely flat, exist somewhere
  between two and three dimensions. <br/><br/>However, Gaiman excels at inventing
  creative worlds, and Neverwhere is a prime example. Here, he manages to invent a
  London underworld, filled with the people and places who fell through the cracks
  of London Above. It''s a fun romp, by no means brilliant, but a hell of a way to
  kill a couple of evenings. '
