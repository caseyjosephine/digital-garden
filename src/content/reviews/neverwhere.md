So Gaiman's writing sometimes grates on me. He overuses adverbs, the pacing is uneven, and his characters, while not completely flat, exist somewhere between two and three dimensions. <br/><br/>However, Gaiman excels at inventing creative worlds, and Neverwhere is a prime example. Here, he manages to invent a London underworld, filled with the people and places who fell through the cracks of London Above. It's a fun romp, by no means brilliant, but a hell of a way to kill a couple of evenings.
