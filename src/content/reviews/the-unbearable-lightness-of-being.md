My Review: Great writers walk a fine line between connecting to their readers by telling
  them things they already know, and surprising them with ideas that they haven't
  thought before. Kundera is a master of making the readers thoughts feel somewhat
  alien, even as he makes novel thoughts feel like the reader's own. <br/><br/>The
  ideas in this book make me feel like Kundera has swan-dived into my brain and is
  now swimming around with my own assumptions about life. I'm sure he'll surface again,
  gracefully, and when I least expect him to.
