Great writers walk a fine line between connecting to their readers by telling them things they already know, and surprising them with ideas that they haven't thought before. Kundera is a master of making the readers thoughts feel somewhat alien, even as he makes novel thoughts feel like the reader's own. <br/><br/>The ideas in this book make me feel like Kundera has swan-dived into my brain and is now swimming around with my own assumptions about life. I'm sure he'll surface again, gracefully, and when I least expect him to.
