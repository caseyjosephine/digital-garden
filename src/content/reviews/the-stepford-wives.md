I completely forgot that I read this book. Take from that what you will. From what I remember, it's a fairly realistic account of the type of housewives that live in places such as Orange County, CA, and the Upper East Side of Manhattan. That pretty much makes it non-fiction. The ending definitely explained quite a bit about the dominant sociocultural, heteronormative paradigm under which we live.
