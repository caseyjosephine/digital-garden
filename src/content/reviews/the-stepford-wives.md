My Review: I completely forgot that I read this book. Take from that what you will.
  From what I remember, it's a fairly realistic account of the type of housewives
  that live in places such as Orange County, CA, and the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
  That pretty much makes it non-fiction. The ending definitely explained quite a bit
  about the dominant sociocultural, heteronormative paradigm under which we live.
