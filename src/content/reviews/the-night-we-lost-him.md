The Night We Lost Him is a slow-burn mystery with compelling characters, hampered by poor plotting. <br/><br/>There is surface-level intrigue here: Nora's dad is dead, possibly murdered. Unfortunately, the reader is rarely compelled to care about this maybe murder. My reaction upon discovering the secret was an unenthused "okay, sure, I guess that makes sense."<br/><br/>In six months I'll likely forget the details, if I even remember that I read this one at all. I wish Laura Dave would go all-in on literary fiction rather than shoehorning her work into a genre that's not serving her.
