My Review: 'The Night We Lost Him is a slow-burn mystery with compelling characters,
  hampered by poor plotting. <br/><br/>There is surface-level intrigue here: Nora''s
  dad is dead, possibly murdered. Unfortunately, the reader is rarely compelled to
  care about this maybe murder. My reaction upon discovering the secret was an unenthused
  "okay, sure, I guess that makes sense."<br/><br/>In six months I''ll likely forget
  the details, if I even remember that I read this one at all. I wish Laura Dave would
  go all-in on literary fiction rather than shoehorning her work into a genre that''s
  not serving her.'
