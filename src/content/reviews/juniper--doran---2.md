My Review: 'I loved this book even more than I loved [b:Wise Child|540489|Wise Child
  (Doran, #1)|Monica Furlong|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1308963110s/540489.jpg|871078].
  It made me want to learn about herbs. It made me want to learn how to use a spinning
  wheel.  You know what? I did learn a bit about herbs, mostly how to cook with them.
  And I still think it would be badass if I owned a spinning wheel. '
