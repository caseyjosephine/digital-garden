I loved this book even more than I loved [b:Wise Child|540489|Wise Child (Doran, #1)|Monica Furlong|http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1308963110s/540489.jpg|871078]. It made me want to learn about herbs. It made me want to learn how to use a spinning wheel.  You know what? I did learn a bit about herbs, mostly how to cook with them. And I still think it would be badass if I owned a spinning wheel.
