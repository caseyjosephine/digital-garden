My Review: 'When people find out I have degrees in psychology, they tend to make a
  few assumptions. First, they ask me if I''m "psychoanalyzing" them, which I''m not;
  not only because psychoanalysis is pseudoscience (only English majors love Freud,
  for reasons I''m sure Freud would trace back to genitals, their own or someone else''s),
  but also because I''m generally more interested in my own cleverness than other
  people''s problems. Second, they figure I''ve been trained as a clinician, as if
  I have a secret life as a therapist that no one knows about (I don''t). Finally,
  they ask me about books they''ve read that they''re sure I''ve read. Usually, they''re
  just interested in self-help drivel, but sometimes they want to talk about this
  book.<br/><br/>Which is interesting, because this is not a book about psychology,
  in the same way that Animal Farm is not a book about agriculture. This is a novel
  by Ken Kesey, who went to graduate school for creative writing and also did a lot
  of drugs. He spent a fair amount of time hanging out on a bus with Neal Cassady,
  The Grateful Dead, and the rest of the Merry Pranksters, dosing the communal Kool-Aid
  bowl with LSD. One Flew Over the Cuckoo''s Nest is not supposed to be a realistic
  book about mental institutions (thank goodness, because the treatment people are
  getting in this book is completely unethical). <br/><br/>So what''s it about? The
  man, man. The man is always trying to put you down, tell you how to be. And you
  just listen to the man, man, because the man just has you in his grip. And you''ve
  got to question this stuff. Throw off the shackles of the society into which you''ve
  been inculcated and expand your mind, man. <br/><br/>(Note: Kesey seems to think
  you should really only question the things about the world that make it less fun
  and stuff. Minorities are for stereotyping, and women are for reminding you how
  emasculated you''ve become and/or fucking you. When I say "you" I''m assuming you
  are a white, heterosexual male, because you don''t even have to take drugs to realize
  that no one else really matters. Never mind the fact that the book is ostensibly
  written by a Native American, because that dude has no real voice and whatever,
  he''s half-white so it''s okay if we half care about him.)<br/><br/>Of course, the
  sexism is problematic: we''re not supposed to mind that the "hero" has raped a woman,
  and we''re supposed to cheer when the powerful women get put in their place. But
  my major issue with the book is the portrayal of mental health treatment as being
  mostly useless. Yes, things were not so great in the 50''s, yes, shock therapy was
  terrifying and, yes, lobotomies were horrendous. However, mental illness isn''t
  something you can just rebel your way out of: that''s a bit like praying away cancer.
  Mental illness is already under-diagnosed, and this is another cultural artifact
  that suggests that people should be wary of treatment.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought
  this book was vaguely interesting but mostly juvenile and lacking in nuance. I''m
  finding myself having a hard time reading topical books from mid-century US writers,
  which is perhaps another indication that my generation inhabits a completely different
  world.  And, not to seem like an ingrate, but I just can''t relate. I don''t have
  a strong rebellious streak, and I don''t possess an irrational fear of communists,
  and even though I know that big brother really could pay attention to anything I
  do, I also realize my group texts about where we should go for a beer after work
  are probably not getting much airtime at the NSA. Maybe this is the way my kids
  will feel when they go back and read books about student loan debt, denial of climate
  change, and inane iPhone apps. I hope so.<br/><br/>Then again, maybe this book truly
  has little substance, and maybe it will recede into the bowels of history. Maybe
  we should think of this book as evidence that drugs can make you paranoid enough
  to solipsistically conclude that everything is just a big conspiracy theory and
  you''re the only one who can figure out the charade. That, my friends, is actually
  an empirical question. Please, someone, pass the Kool-Aid.'
