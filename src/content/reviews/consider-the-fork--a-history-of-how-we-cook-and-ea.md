My Review: 'As I type this review, I''m sipping a glass of lightly-oaked Oregon Pinot
  Noir and noshing on some balls of fresh mozzarella, which I quickly marinated in
  olive oil (along with sea salt and red pepper flakes) while I finished the last
  chapter of Consider the Fork. The wine wasn''t really prepared to preserve the grape
  harvest (it''s a fine wine, after all), and the mozzarella wasn''t made out of the
  desire to preserve fresh milk that would otherwise spoil. No, I simply picked these
  items because I like them, which is a pretty wonderful thing to be able to do when
  you really think about it.<br/><br/>Consider the Fork is a history of cooking, as
  seen through the tools we use to cook our food. I''m a romanticizer of cooking tools:
  when I moved from Chicago to San Francisco, I refused to put my favorite cast iron
  skillet in a box and pack it away. I needed it on my person, a comforting reminder
  of the joyous nights I''ve spent in the kitchen pan-roasting chicken thighs, or
  making cornbread, or rendering the fat from some duck legs, which I finished in
  the oven with a little bit of red wine while I used the reserved duck fat to flavor
  the potatoes. But these tools are more than beloved possessions, and Bee Wilson
  uses them to tell a story about how we cook. Any foodie can wax poetic about their
  perfectly-sharped chef''s knives, but it takes a great writer to bring interest
  to egg beaters and vegetable peelers. Luckily, Wilson is up to the job.<br/><br/>Most
  interesting, to me, was the final chapter, in which Wilson considers [b:Modernist
  Cuisine|8885824|Modernist Cuisine  The Art and Science of Cooking|Nathan Myhrvold|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1328774509s/8885824.jpg|13761755]
  and the newfound obsession with the perfect kitchen. Now, I like to use soy lecithin
  to whip up some salt foam to float on top of margaritas as much as the next girl,
  but I''m generally somewhat wary of molecular gastronomy. I''m the kind of person
  who doesn''t mind rendering my own fresh lard, or mixing up mayo from scratch, using
  a balloon whisk while I slowly add olive oil one drop at a time. Wilson writes about
  new technologies with the same degree of mesmerized skepticism: she lauds sous vide
  even as she notes that Adrià''s staff enjoys traditional family meals before service.
  <br/><br/>A word about the "perfect" kitchen: I have been relatively vocal in my
  disdain for those who obsessively create a showplace kitchen, only to most rely
  on ready meals and takeout. A Viking range and All-Clad pans are certainly nice
  to have, but they don''t make anyone a great cook. I''m perfectly capable of turning
  out some great food in a tiny galley kitchen with minimal counter space, and I''m
  <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com">not the only one</a>. While I do think that
  everyone who wants to cook needs to have a perfectly-sharp chef''s knife and a cast-iron
  skillet, I think a great cook can do will with the most minimal of kitchens; after
  all, the quality of the ingredients matters above all else. We should never let
  lack of money or lack of counter space stand in the way of our culinary dreams,
  nor should we use the lack of a perfect kitchen as an excuse not to cook.<br/><br/>For
  dinner, I''m going to be making roasted smoked duck sausage and asparagus, which
  I''ll serve alongside last night''s leftover mashed potatoes. Thanks to this book,
  I''ll be able to think about the juxtaposition of the older method of preserving
  meat and the new role played by refrigeration. I''ll think about the utensils we
  use to cook the meal, and the cultural conventions behind them. Any book that helps
  me think about the tools involved in dinner in a new way certainly deserves a recommendation,
  and I think this will be especially interesting to cooks and foodies.'
