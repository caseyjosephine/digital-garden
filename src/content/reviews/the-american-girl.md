My Review: 'I have long been of the opinion that technology should play a limited
  role in fiction. This is not because I''m some sort of Luddite: I''m typing this
  review on my iPad, whilst streaming XM radio through my phone to my Bluetooth speaker,
  taking occasional breaks to check Reddit. In fact, I sometimes feel like an interloper
  at bookstores, because I actually prefer the convenience of a Kindle to the romance
  of physical books (I''m taken to understand that the romance mostly involves the
  smell. After working in a library for four years, I''ve deconstructed this smell
  with some degree of accuracy: it''s two parts dirt, one part must, and zero parts
  appealing). At this point, my dear reader should note that book reviews are a form
  of nonfiction, thus I can name drop contemporary technologies with impunity.<br/><br/>My
  problem with technology in fiction mostly boils down to Moore''s Law, which postulates
  that chip efficiency will double every couple of years. This has a few major implications,
  the first being that my iPhone will become woefully incapable of running any app
  within 24 months of purchase, and the second being that any mention of technology
  in a book will likely be outdated once the manuscript reaches print. I''ve oft used
  this argument to pontificate about the fact that Twin Peaks retains a timelessness
  partially due to its lack of reliance on technology, whereas episodes of CSI are
  immediately placed within a particular temporal space, rendering their relevance
  somewhat liminal. <br/><br/>Anyway, The American Girl is a quick read that relies
  on technology, including (but certainly not limited to) a heavy-handed description
  of the uses for Snapchat. On some level, this is excellent, as the youths around
  me have yet to proffer a thorough explication of digital ephemerality, especially
  as it relates to a paradigm in which storage space is only getting cheaper (see
  also, Moore''s Law). However, extensive use of technology places The American Girl
  strictly within CSI territory: incapable of timelessness, but not a terrible use
  of a few idle hours, all things considered.'
