My Review: I put off reading Pillars of the Earth for quite a long time. Now, I definitely
  wanted to read it, as many of my friends have recommended it to me. I bought a used
  copy on Amazon, then got a little put-off by the sheer size of the book. I figured
  I'd get a Kindle copy instead, but that just languished on my digital bookshelf,
  collecting pixelated dust. I don't even remember why I bought the audiobook; seriously,
  at that point I was wondering if I would ever actually read this book.<br/><br/>The
  problem was, mostly, the subject material. Cathedrals are beautiful, but I don't
  find the church particularly compelling. I didn't know how Ken Follet could make
  me interested in an epic story centered on building a cathedral. <br/><br/>Turns
  out, I vastly underestimated Ken Follet. The Pillars of the Earth is a page turner
  of an epic novel with a ton of action and political intrigue; it reminded me of
  Les Miserables more than anything else, and that's one of my favorite books. Both
  books are epic historical fiction, both have characters that stick with you, and
  both somehow maintain a message of hope despite the fact that horrible things keep
  happening. <br/><br/>But the craziest thing is that I kept having to remind myself
  that I wasn't reading A Song of Ice and Fire, The Lies of Locke Lamora, Mistborn,
  or another epic fantasy book. I mean, I know there that dragons aren't real, and
  they didn't exist in the 12th century either, but I kept expecting dragons. But
  whatever, it's cool. This was definitely a five-star read for me, even with the
  historically-accurate lack of dragons.
