So I must have read this sometime right before the movie came out, because I definitely have the version of the book with the film cover (judge not lest ye be judged, people, I was young and spent a little too much time at the Borders in Goleta, which is sadly no more). Anyway, IMDB puts the movie release at Christmas 2005, which sounds about right.<br/><br/>Anyway, I brought this book home on a break from college, and completely devoured it. Seriously, I could not put it down. I hadn't really been exposed to, well, anything about Japan except the local sushi restaurant, and Memoirs of a Geisha actually started impressionable young me on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWYoIoqJURA">a love-affair with Japan</a>. Maybe it's not the best book (it's not, really), but it was exactly what I needed at the time.<br/><br/>Fun story: when I moved out of my parents' place to go to college, my brother took over my room. But, it wasn't big enough, so my parents actually knocked out the wall between the rooms to make his new room bigger. Which really should have annoyed me, but I was too busy reading this to be bothered. Really.
