My Review: 'So I must have read this sometime right before the movie came out, because
  I definitely have the version of the book with the film cover (judge not lest ye
  be judged, people, I was young and spent a little too much time at the Borders in
  Goleta, which is sadly no more). Anyway, IMDB puts the movie release at Christmas
  2005, which sounds about right.<br/><br/>Anyway, I brought this book home on a break
  from college, and completely devoured it. Seriously, I could not put it down. I
  hadn''t really been exposed to, well, anything about Japan except the local sushi
  restaurant, and Memoirs of a Geisha actually started impressionable young me on
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWYoIoqJURA">a love-affair with Japan</a>.
  Maybe it''s not the best book (it''s not, really), but it was exactly what I needed
  at the time.<br/><br/>Fun story: when I moved out of my parents'' place to go to
  college, my brother took over my room. But, it wasn''t big enough, so my parents
  actually knocked out the wall between the rooms to make his new room bigger. Which
  really should have annoyed me, but I was too busy reading this to be bothered. Really.'
