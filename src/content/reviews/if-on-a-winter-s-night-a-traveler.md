My Review: 'Sometimes, when I get distracted from what I''m reading (which is more
  often than I''d like to admit), I sample the first chapters of other books. Some
  are so sublime that I jump in, feet first, and barely come up for air until I''ve
  finished the whole book ([b:Middlemarch|19089|Middlemarch|George Eliot|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1386924110s/19089.jpg|1461747]).
  Other first chapters I return to time and time again, without really feeling the
  need to read the rest of the book ([b:Moby-Dick; or, The Whale|153747|Moby-Dick;
  or, The Whale|Herman Melville|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1327940656s/153747.jpg|2409320],
  which I did finish eventually). Most often, I sample a first chapter and file it
  away, so that I can pick up the book again when I''m in the apposite mood.<br/><br/>If
  on a Winter''s Night a Traveler is a collection of beginnings, with a parallel story
  that explains the beginnings in a way that makes more sense than you might imagine.
  Yes, this is meta-fiction, and I think that someone who doesn''t really enjoy that
  might be disappointed. But if postmodernism is your thing, you''ll probably enjoy
  this one. Perhaps unsurprisingly, mine edition became heavily annotated.<br/><br/>Of
  course, beginnings are only fun for so long. After reading just the first chapters
  of a bunch of different books, I start to feel a little dirty, like I''ve done something
  I''m not proud of. The same thing happened here: I''m glad to be back to reading
  novels that start, then have a middle, then end. That''s really the way it''s meant
  to be.'
