Sometimes, when I get distracted from what I'm reading (which is more often than I'd like to admit), I sample the first chapters of other books. Some are so sublime that I jump in, feet first, and barely come up for air until I've finished the whole book ([b:Middlemarch|19089|Middlemarch|George Eliot|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1386924110s/19089.jpg|1461747]). Other first chapters I return to time and time again, without really feeling the need to read the rest of the book ([b:Moby-Dick; or, The Whale|153747|Moby-Dick; or, The Whale|Herman Melville|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1327940656s/153747.jpg|2409320], which I did finish eventually). Most often, I sample a first chapter and file it away, so that I can pick up the book again when I'm in the apposite mood.<br/><br/>If on a Winter's Night a Traveler is a collection of beginnings, with a parallel story that explains the beginnings in a way that makes more sense than you might imagine. Yes, this is meta-fiction, and I think that someone who doesn't really enjoy that might be disappointed. But if postmodernism is your thing, you'll probably enjoy this one. Perhaps unsurprisingly, mine edition became heavily annotated.<br/><br/>Of course, beginnings are only fun for so long. After reading just the first chapters of a bunch of different books, I start to feel a little dirty, like I've done something I'm not proud of. The same thing happened here: I'm glad to be back to reading novels that start, then have a middle, then end. That's really the way it's meant to be.
