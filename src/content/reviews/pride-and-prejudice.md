My Review: 'I don''t know how I got through 21 years of my life without reading this
  book. I had always been a hopeless romantic, but I figured Pride and Prejudice would
  be a similar experience to my mind-numbing trek through Jane Eyre in high school
  English. I had wanted to read the book before the movie (starring Keira Knightely)
  came out, but I ended up forgetting my grand plans and leaving my book unopened
  on the shelf.<br/><br/>Once I finally got into the book, I couldn''t believe that
  it had taken me so long to read it! I got completely caught up in the relationships,
  wondering how everything was going to finally work out. I finished the book hungry
  for more, and I now plan to get started with Emma. Jane Austen may not be a technically
  brilliant writer, but she sure does know how to draw out complicated relationships
  with humor and wit. '
