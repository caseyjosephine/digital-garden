I don't know how I got through 21 years of my life without reading this book. I had always been a hopeless romantic, but I figured Pride and Prejudice would be a similar experience to my mind-numbing trek through Jane Eyre in high school English. I had wanted to read the book before the movie (starring Keira Knightely) came out, but I ended up forgetting my grand plans and leaving my book unopened on the shelf.<br/><br/>Once I finally got into the book, I couldn't believe that it had taken me so long to read it! I got completely caught up in the relationships, wondering how everything was going to finally work out. I finished the book hungry for more, and I now plan to get started with Emma. Jane Austen may not be a technically brilliant writer, but she sure does know how to draw out complicated relationships with humor and wit.
