My Review: 'This little slip of a book was a surprise: it was not a novel about race,
  like I was expecting, but a bildungsroman about a young girl from South Carolina
  who has a lot of issues to work though. The voice of the young narrator, Lily Owens,
  was both poetic and realistic, which I liked. Also, the book really is about bees,
  which I loved.<br/><br/>Somehow, I don''t have much to say about this, perhaps because
  it''s quite an internal story, or possibly because it''s fairly simplistic. In a
  good way. It felt like a young adult novel more than anything else, which might
  be why I keep thinking "I liked this!" without really being able to say what I liked.
  I wish I had read it in high school, but it turned out to be a quick little read
  over a few lazy days. Now that I''m thinking a bit more, I do like that it dealt
  with some potential "very special episode" material in a personal way that didn''t
  feel like pandering. It also evoked a sense of place: I felt like I could feel the
  heat and smell the Carolina jasmine, even though I mostly read this cooped up in
  my apartment during the tail-end of a Chicago winter.<br/><br/>The one thing I disliked
  about the book was the May character, who felt overly contrived. I always feel a
  bit manipulated when a writer <spoiler>kills off a character for no other reason
  than to give the illusion of emotional depth. Plus, I dislike mawkish sentimentality.
  It would have been better without her.</spoiler>.<br/><br/>Anyway, I still liked
  this book overall. Yeah, it felt like an Oprah book (you know, because it was),
  but then again, sometimes that''s what you''re in the mood for.'
