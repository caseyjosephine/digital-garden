3.5 stars, and I'm rounding down because I find the Ironborn so ridiculously boring that I started groaning every time I read the name Greyjoy. I mean, really, do all of these characters really need their own POV chapters? I'd rather find out about whatever it is they're doing by means of straight exposition. <br/><br/>(Seriously, if you haven't read the first three, stop now. Spoilers, I can't help it, because if I talk about people you will know they're not dead as of the beginning of book 4, and that's something you don't want to know),<br/><br/>There's some good stuff in here though: I always enjoy chapters from Sansa's point of view, and the Sansa/Brienne of Tarth plot is pretty interesting. Jon Snow isn't really around, but we do get some cool stuff about Samwell, and Arya has gotten a lot more engaging now that she's not mumbling about every single person she's going to kill eventually. Shit's going down in Dorne and it seems pretty cool, but since it's cool it's confined to only a few chapters (seriously, GRRM, why? Who cares about Krakens and kingsmoots when <spoiler>the people in Dorne are plotting to overthrow the King and install Myrcella as queen??</spoiler>). Braavos seems like a cool place, too: it kind of reminds me of San Francisco.<br/><br/>The problem with the book is that it's almost a thousand pages long and not that much happens. It's somewhat maddening because the stage is clearly being set for something, we just never really get to it. It's a little bit like watching a making-of featurette for an upcoming movie that you really, really want to see. And it's cool to see all the characters and hear them talk about stuff, but it's not particularly satisfying. I mean, the featurette mostly just reminds you that what you really want to see is the actual movie. In real life, you can skip the making of and just watch the damn thing, but A Feast for Crows isn't exactly skippable. However, I'm still glad I slogged through the book. Now, bring on the dragons.
