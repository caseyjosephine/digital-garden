My Review: 'The plot of The Magus is convoluted at best, but it may be more accurate
  to call it outlandish. On top of that, the writing is incredibly pretentious (think
  literary allusions, tossed among art references, scattered with untranslated French).
  These sound like criticisms, but they are actually reasons why I loved The Magus
  (after all, <i>à chacun son goût</i>). As you may have gathered, this will not be
  an easy book to review.<br/><br/>At the risk of sounding more than a little trite,
  this book is like an onion (you know, because of the layers). The interesting thing
  is that each layer of plot is self-contained, with only a feeling of déjà vu (or
  occasionally jamais vu) to remind you that these layers are connected to each other
  at the root. And as you cut into it, things become increasingly uncomfortable. But
  ultimately (and here''s where the metaphor begins to fall apart), if you let them
  caramelize for long enough, get something delicious.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, The
  Magus is a meditation on the meaning of fiction, both in content and style. Fowles
  writes with wink: he apes "one twist after another" writers like Alexandre Dumas,
  even as his high-minded characters dismiss them. Early in the novel, Conchis, the
  eccentric millionaire who drives the plot of the novel, claims "Words are for truth.
  For facts. Not fiction." He then begets a world so fantastic that it could never
  happen in reality.<br/><br/>And therein lies the paradox of fiction: we go into
  it knowing that stories aren''t true. When we read (or watch a movie, or see a play,
  etc.) we tacitly agree to be a player in a game. If the players pretend it''s real,
  we''ll go along with it. The interesting thing is that, even though we know it''s
  not real, we may experience intense emotions (catharsis, whatever you want to call
  it), whereas the characters are unable to feel anything.<br/><br/>This is post-modernism
  at it''s best, and definitely worth a read if you''re into that sort of thing. Or
  even if you''re not. It''s a damn good book.'
