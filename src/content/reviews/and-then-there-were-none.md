Ten strangers, mysteriously called to an island, each with a secret they thought would stay buried. They watch, horrified, as their fellow "soldiers" (insert a different, incredibly racist word here if you have a previous edition) get picked off one by one.<br/><br/>And Then There Were None is an incredibly fun lithe mystery. There's not much more to say about it, except that it felt familiar yet I still found myself surprised by the resolution. This is the first Agatha Christie book I've read (I know, shameful!), and I'll definitely be reading more. It's fun to have a light read that I can finish in a sitting or two.
