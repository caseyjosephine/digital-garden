A slim volume about the power of narratives. Gottschall presents empirical evidence about the stories that we tell ourselves, although there's not anything new here. Unfortunately, Gottschall is better at telling stories about the results than describing the experiments in sufficient detail, although he is an English professor and this is a popular science book, so I can't begrudge him too much.
