My Review: A slim volume about the power of narratives. Gottschall presents empirical
  evidence about the stories that we tell ourselves, although there's not anything
  new here. Unfortunately, Gottschall is better at telling stories about the results
  than describing the experiments in sufficient detail, although he is an English
  professor and this is a popular science book, so I can't begrudge him too much.
