My Review: 'Spoiler alert: this book expresses mostly negative opinions about Greek
  life. If you''re a former sister looking for a book that''s the journalistic equivalent
  of Leslie Gore''s hit song "Sunshine, Lollipops & Rainbows," maybe you should just
  call up your old sorority friends and talk about how awesome you guys all were together.
  But that sisterly Kumbaya shtick doesn''t sell books (which you might have learned
  in your Business 101 class, if you hadn''t skipped it to play vodka pong), so don''t
  expect to be praised in this one.<br/><br/>Anyway, this book talks about sorority
  girls. As a feminist, I balk at the term "girl" used for grown women, even if these
  grown women are making incredibly childish decisions. For a year, journalist Alexandra
  Robbins went undercover at two different (unidentified) sororities at an (unnamed)
  State University. She tells the stories of four young women in sororities, each
  of whom had mixed experiences in the sisterhood.<br/><br/>In college, I had limited
  contact with women who had pledged sororities. In my mind, they existed in a benignly
  inane orbit around the University, the pillar of knowledge that held my universe
  together (you know, because of the awesome force of knowledge gravity. Sorry, I''m
  bad at similes today.). The only greek letters I associate with myself are Phi Beta
  Kappa (nerds represent!). In general, I found that sorority members were perfectly
  lovely one-on-one, but weren''t great to associate with in larger numbers. <br/><br/>My
  major issue with sororities was the massive, systematized cheating, which was largely
  ignored by the university (and the Communication Department, which was widely known
  to be the easy "sorority major"). Sororities held file drawers full of tests, which
  they passed out to their sisters (to the detriment of anyone else in the course).
  I was shocked by their lack of respect for higher education: I''d expect this sort
  of thing at a second-tier regional state school, but I went to a public ivy.<br/><br/>There
  are many "scandalous" behaviors discussed in the book, but none are surprising.
  NEWSFLASH: college students binge drink, have sex, and smoke weed. I could tell
  a bunch of shocking stories about college, and I spent most of my time at the library
  (I won''t, though, because this is the internet). More interesting were the weird
  rituals associated with being greek, like "serenades" (entire fraternities court
  entire sororities by singing slutified versions of terrible pop songs to each other)
  and rush. Sorority life seems to consist of endless meetings and lots of parties
  with fraternities. Learning is clearly not a priority. <br/><br/>Sororities have
  the air of upper-crust societies, but the women don''t seem to participate in many
  cultural activities. Philanthropy is supposed to be important, but "service" mostly
  means playing drunken volleyball games. Other activities range from the patently
  bourgeois (e.g., conspicuous consumption of logo-laden designer duds) to the surprisingly
  trashy (e.g., Jimmy Buffett''s Margaritaville). These ladies aren''t reading experimental
  fiction and hitting up student art shows. Within the post-collegiate social hierarchy,
  they''re the trophy wives of the parvenus of tomorrow.<br/><br/>Young women: I urge
  you to get involved at your university, but don''t do it by jello wrestling your
  "sister" at a frat party. Instead, try to find opportunities for undergraduate research.
  Attend arts programs and special lectures. Take advantage of the wide range of courses
  offered, and try to actually study for them*. College is one of few times in life
  where you can focus on your own education. Don''t squander it.<br/><br/>And really,
  don''t drink any blue drinks. Just trust me on that one.<br/><br/>*Because you''ve
  read this far, here''s my verified, effective method to get an A in any course you
  take: attend class. Read the books (and any supplementary materials) as they''re
  assigned. Do all assigned work. Attend office hours if anything isn''t clear. There
  you go.'
