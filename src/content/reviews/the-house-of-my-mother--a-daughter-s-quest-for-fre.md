My Review: 'One of the (many) reasons why I stepped away from social media was the
  discomfort I felt when my friends and family members started sharing too much about
  their children. <br/><br/>Children are great. They also can''t consent to having
  their lives turned into content for the amusement of their parents (not to mention
  the profits of wildly unethical corporations that only care about this quarter''s
  earnings).<br/><br/>The transactional exchange of voyeurism for external validation
  from strangers is bad enough, but it gets worse when real money gets involved. The
  minimal regulations that allow child actors to be taken advantage of by profit-seeking
  parents have come under fire over the past few decades, but where is the outrage
  over mommy vloggers who don''t have to adhere to any standards at all?<br/><br/>The
  House of My Mother is an incredibly brave memoir written by Shari Franke, a young
  woman who was used as fodder for a "wholesome" family YouTube channel while being
  abused behind the scenes. <br/><br/>This book is important, disturbing, and a must-read
  for anyone who cares about the impact of technology on child development. <br/><br/>If
  the exploitation of child influencers bothers you, please contact your local congresspeople
  and demand legislation that protects children by regulating this heinous industry.
  The tech companies will not police themselves, and children will continue to be
  traumatized by abusive families until regulations are put in place. '
