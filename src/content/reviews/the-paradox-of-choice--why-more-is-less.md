My Review: 'Have I read this one before? Because it really feels like I''ve read this
  one before.<br/><br/>I know I haven''t actually read The Paradox of Choice, forgotten
  it, and then picked it up again years later only to find it intensely familiar.
  My book-related record keeping is far too complete and obsessive for that. I chose
  this book because it''s a classic, one that has been oft referenced in other books
  that I''ve enjoyed. While I can fault the book for being somewhat repetitive, I
  can''t fault it for being influential. My three star rating feels disingenuous,
  kind of like the people who claim The Beatles are unoriginal because a ton of other
  bands have copied them. However, I think I''ve already established that my ratings
  are capricious, and violate all sorts of statistical assumptions, and are generally
  a bad use of a continuous, quantitative measure. I''m okay with that.<br/><br/>If
  you haven''t read all those books that cite this book, the main idea is that that
  we have more choices than ever before, and we have a lay presumption that those
  choices should make us happy. Unfortunately, empirical research suggests that more
  choices actually make us more overwhelmed, less satisfied when we do reach a decision,
  and more likely to avoid making any decisions altogether. Additionally, some people
  (maximizers) are caught up with making only the best decisions; Schwartz postulates
  a causal relationship between increased choice and depression, although this hypothesis
  is fairly speculative. I''m apparently a maximizer, because my Netflix ritual involves
  scrolling through all the movies for twenty minutes looking for the best one, getting
  frustrated, and turning on Friends reruns again.<br/><br/>One terrifying insight
  from this book is that 2004 was kind of a long time ago. I sort of knew this already,
  because I''ve recently had some Cabernet Sauvignon from 2004 that had developed
  a really lovely bouquet. The examples provided in this book range from buying a
  new CD player, to shopping around for long distance service, to picking out a movie
  from the video rental store. Schwartz mentions that real estate is usually a good
  investment! There''s even a hypothetical recent college grad who is fielding four
  different job offers (!!) and making trade-offs between a great salary with only
  moderate room for advancement, and a good salary with lots of room for advancement.
  In 2016, that kid is totally back at home living with his parents, bemoaning the
  fact that entry level jobs in his field require six years of experience and a masters
  degree, and still barely pay above minimum wage. (Note: my iPad just tried to autocorrect
  jobs to Jo''s. Twice. Even my iPad knows that jobs don''t really exist anymore.)<br/><br/>Overall,
  this is a quick read, but much of the same material has been covered elsewhere,
  more recently, and with fewer antiquated references to print media and cassette
  tapes. A contemporary reader would likely find [b:Thinking, Fast and Slow|11468377|Thinking,
