The Snow Child is beautiful fairy tale for adults. It's based on a Russian story: an old couple who are unable to have children of their own create a child out of snow, and she comes to life.<br/><br/>This really wasn't what I was expecting; in fact, it was much better than I thought it would be. Eowyn Ivey's writing (can we just take a second to reflect on how awesome Ivey's parents are for naming her Eowyn?) evokes the snowy appeal of the Alaskan frontier in a way that reminded me of [a:Willa Cather|881203|Willa Cather|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1287462696p2/881203.jpg]'s Nebraska in [b:O Pioneers!|77942|O Pioneers!|Willa Cather|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1347989298s/77942.jpg|467254]. The characters are so real that it didn't need the conceit of the snow child, although the magical realism only adds to the story.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this. It's a quick read, although I tried to read it in smaller doses so it would go by more slowly. And now, I can't wait for the first snow of winter to fall.
