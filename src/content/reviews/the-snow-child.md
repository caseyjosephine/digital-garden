My Review: 'The Snow Child is beautiful fairy tale for adults. It''s based on a Russian
  story: an old couple who are unable to have children of their own create a child
  out of snow, and she comes to life.<br/><br/>This really wasn''t what I was expecting;
  in fact, it was much better than I thought it would be. Eowyn Ivey''s writing (can
  we just take a second to reflect on how awesome Ivey''s parents are for naming her
  Eowyn?) evokes the snowy appeal of the Alaskan frontier in a way that reminded me
  of [a:Willa Cather|881203|Willa Cather|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1287462696p2/881203.jpg]''s
  Nebraska in [b:O Pioneers!|77942|O Pioneers!|Willa Cather|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1347989298s/77942.jpg|467254].
  The characters are so real that it didn''t need the conceit of the snow child, although
  the magical realism only adds to the story.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this.
  It''s a quick read, although I tried to read it in smaller doses so it would go
  by more slowly. And now, I can''t wait for the first snow of winter to fall.'
