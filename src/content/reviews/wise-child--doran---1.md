My Review: 'I was completely obsessed with this book when I was little. My mom read
  it to me, chapter by chapter, before I was really able to read chapter books. I
  read it tons and tons of times after that. It''s the story of a young girl living
  in Scotland who is forced to live with Juniper, an enigmatic single woman. The woman
  turns out to be a witch, who teaches Wise Child witchcraft. <br/><br/>Fun fact:
  when I was little, I thought that Cornwall (where Juniper is from) was somewhere
  near India, mostly due to the depiction of Juniper on the cover. Apparently I was
  not a star geography student in elementary school.'
