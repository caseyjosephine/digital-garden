I was completely obsessed with this book when I was little. My mom read it to me, chapter by chapter, before I was really able to read chapter books. I read it tons and tons of times after that. It's the story of a young girl living in Scotland who is forced to live with Juniper, an enigmatic single woman. The woman turns out to be a witch, who teaches Wise Child witchcraft. <br/><br/>Fun fact: when I was little, I thought that Cornwall (where Juniper is from) was somewhere near India, mostly due to the depiction of Juniper on the cover. Apparently I was not a star geography student in elementary school.
