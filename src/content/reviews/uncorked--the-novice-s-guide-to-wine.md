A quick little introduction to wine that's too basic for me, but I still learned a few things. Apparently those huge jugs of wine used to be straight up marketed as "burgundy" back in the day, which is kind of hilarious.<br/><br/>There's a super weird section in here where Paul Kreider recommends pretending like you don't know shit about wine in order to not sound like a douchebag. He says you should say something along the lines of "I've heard sometimes sugar doesn't ferment all the way and that makes wine sweeter, did that happen here?" If you know perfectly well what residual sugar is, it's fine to ask your sommelier or friendly wine shop owner about the residual sugar in a particular wine. The way to not sound douchey is to not act like a douchebag.
