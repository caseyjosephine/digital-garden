My Review: Sometimes, I think it would be nice to be British. After all, they have
  health care and sensible gun laws, and they sound cool when they say the word "schedule."
  It would have been particularly useful to be British whilst reading Notes from a
  Small Island, as the book is clearly intended for a British audience. This might
  be a much more interesting read for a Brit, or Anglophile, but as I'm just an armchair
  traveler who had never really heard the names "Mark" and "Spencer" spoken within
  the same sentence, I found the references fairly opaque.
