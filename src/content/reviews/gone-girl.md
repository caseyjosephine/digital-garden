So here's some advice: try not to marry someone if you don't know what they're capable of. That's not a spoiler. That's not even bad advice.<br/><br/>This book ended up surprising me. I don't think I can say too much without giving something away. I can say that the review I had been crafting in my mind halfway through reading this book did not end up being a good review for the book I actually read. Take from that what you will. <br/><br/>I will definitely keep my eye on Flynn, and I may pick up one of her previous books next time I head home to visit my folks in California. Definitely a better-than-average beach read.<br/><br/>WARNING: There are spoilers in the comments.
