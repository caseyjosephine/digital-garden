My Review: 'So here''s some advice: try not to marry someone if you don''t know what
  they''re capable of. That''s not a spoiler. That''s not even bad advice.<br/><br/>This
  book ended up surprising me. I don''t think I can say too much without giving something
  away. I can say that the review I had been crafting in my mind halfway through reading
  this book did not end up being a good review for the book I actually read. Take
  from that what you will. <br/><br/>I will definitely keep my eye on Flynn, and I
  may pick up one of her previous books next time I head home to visit my folks in
  California. Definitely a better-than-average beach read.<br/><br/>WARNING: There
  are spoilers in the comments.'
