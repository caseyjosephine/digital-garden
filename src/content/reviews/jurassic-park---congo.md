Jurassic Park has always been a favorite movie of mine, and the book is just as good as the film. The story centers on a theme-park where people can see real dinosaurs, created from DNA found in ancient amber. But the dinosaurs aren't content to be an attraction, and what happens when they escape is completely terrifying.<br/><br/>This is Michael Crichton at his best. The book isn't preachy or annoying, and it reads fast. What's more, the plot, while far-fetched, seems like something that could happen. That's more than I can say for later books like Prey, which seem more delusional than probable.
