If I'm going to rate this book by quality of writing, I'd have to give it 2 stars. This book is full of the kind of pedestrian writing that you see in books like [b:Trading Up|178813|Trading Up|Candace Bushnell|http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1351341588s/178813.jpg|2011131], which I read for about 100 pages in high school before I get fed up with the writing and passed it on to someone with more plebeian tastes. Seriously guys, it's real bad.<br/><br/>However, the trashiness of the plot made this book so fun to read despite the bad writing and campiness, which means I'd rate it 4 stars based on pure enjoyment. This was a perfect vacation read. I'm splitting the difference and giving it 3 stars.<br/><br/>How shall I describe Valley of the Dolls? Imagine Mad Men, which is retro and well acted and generally excellent. Now imagine that Bravo did a contrived reality show to capitalize on the success of Mad Men, about the "Real" Housewives/Kept Women of 1950's Manhattan/Los Angeles, and you'll pretty much get Valley of the Dolls.
