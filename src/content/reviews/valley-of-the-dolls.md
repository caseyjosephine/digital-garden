My Review: 'If I''m going to rate this book by quality of writing, I''d have to give
  it 2 stars. This book is full of the kind of pedestrian writing that you see in
  books like [b:Trading Up|178813|Trading Up|Candace Bushnell|http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1351341588s/178813.jpg|2011131],
  which I read for about 100 pages in high school before I get fed up with the writing
  and passed it on to someone with more plebeian tastes. Seriously guys, it''s real
  bad.<br/><br/>However, the trashiness of the plot made this book so fun to read
  despite the bad writing and campiness, which means I''d rate it 4 stars based on
  pure enjoyment. This was a perfect vacation read. I''m splitting the difference
  and giving it 3 stars.<br/><br/>How shall I describe Valley of the Dolls? Imagine
  Mad Men, which is retro and well acted and generally excellent. Now imagine that
  Bravo did a contrived reality show to capitalize on the success of Mad Men, about
  the "Real" Housewives/Kept Women of 1950''s Manhattan/Los Angeles, and you''ll pretty
  much get Valley of the Dolls. '
