My Review: What did I just read? A psychological horror novel that gets the reader
  deep into the mind of a madman? A powerful meditation on the meaning of art? A retelling
  of Shakespeare's final play, The Tempest?<br/><br/>A love story?<br/><br/>The Collector
  plays around with post-modern ideas in just the way I enjoy. The narrative is wonderfully
  non-linear; the narrators themselves are unreliable. Fowles includes just enough
  intellectual references to major works in the Western Cannon that the reader with
  limited knowledge of literature would have trouble understanding Miranda's inner
  world. However, the real joy comes from the recognition that Fowles does this even
  as he actively subverts the western literary tradition. He's brilliant, and he knows
  it, and the reader does too.<br/><br/>I do not think that the book is a simple story
  about a butterfly collector who grows tired with insects and captures a woman, nor
  do I really think that Miranda truly represents the butterfly. No, Miranda refuses
  to be pinned down; she rejects confinement, she values freedom above all else. It
  is the reader who flits into the net, so taken in by the beautiful artifice of it
  all that they willingly accept the pins because the tableau presents such an aesthetically-arresting
  reconstruction of reality. Fowles has collected us, and, perversely, I love him
  all the more for it.
