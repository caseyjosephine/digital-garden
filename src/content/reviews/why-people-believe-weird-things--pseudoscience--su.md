My Review: '“...no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony
  be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which
  it endeavors to establish.” - David Hume<br/><br/>What kind of person could deny
  that the holocaust actually happened? Who could argue against the evidence for evolution?
  And how do smart people believe such outlandish claims as ESP, alien abductions,
  and haunted houses? In his book, Michael Shermer explains the logical fallacies
  and cycles of belief that cause smart people to believe some really weird stuff.
  This book is worth reading for the in-depth discussion of logical fallacies alone;
  these fallacies should be taught in high school science classes. Shermer points
  out that part of the issue with pseudoscience is the way we approach science eduction:
  as a collection of facts, instead of an imperfect but self-correcting method for
  discovering the truth.<br/><br/>Shermer treats believers kindly: he does not attack
  them as ignorant or crazy. Indeed, he claims that intelligence and belief in weird
  things are completely orthogonal (in other words, statistically unrelated). However,
  he does compare creationists with holocaust deniers (both fringe groups that use
  similar tactics to deny a well-established truth), and he certainly counts a belief
  in God, particularly a belief that God can be proven scientifically, as strange.
  Shermer''s discussion of [a:Ayn Rand|432|Ayn Rand|http://photo.goodreads.com/authors/1168729178p2/432.jpg]''s
  cult of objectivism is amusingly vitriolic, and one of my favorite sections of the
  book.'
