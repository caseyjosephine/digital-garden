My Review: 'Ah, young adult. I am not someone who routinely reads books written for
  children, although I won''t rule them out either. I guess that makes me Y-curious.
  Sometimes, I''ve been pleasantly surprised by the quality of young adult novels
  (The Fault in Our Stars still has me tearing up), but mostly reading YA reminds
  me why I usually swing the other way. Enter Divergent. It sounded interesting, it''s
  rated highly, I figured why not? Answer: because it''s an awful, awful book. It''s
  the worst thing I''ve read since Twilight. But I soldiered on, because Divergent
  is bad in a so bad it''s good kind of way. It was worth it, because I got to laugh
  out loud at quotes like this “Something about him makes me feel like I am about
  to fall. Or turn to liquid. Or burst into flames.” Or this “I am selfish. I am brave.”
  <br/><br/>Tris is born into a dystopian version of Chicago in which the city''s
  citizens are divided into factions that are so functionally useless that even a
  subpar political science student who happened to to high on acid would be like "Dude,
  that would never work." Scratch that: even the house Republicans would think that
  this is a terrible idea, and their idea of good government is shutting it down and
  giving everyone a gun. <br/><br/>Right, so in this world you can only be one type
  of person: smart, brave, selfless, friendly, or honest. In other words, Ravenclaw,
  Gryffindor, and three different types of Hufflepuff. Apparently, these qualities
  are mutually exclusive, so you can only pick one. Being a multifaceted person (aka
  Divergent) is deemed incredibly dangerous, probably because writing psychologically
  real characters is, like, totally hard.<br/><br/>Anyway, the plot of Divergent revolves
  around all the 16 year olds deciding what type of person they''re going to be (because
  it makes sense to let children whose frontal lobes aren''t even fully developed
  make important decisions that will impact them for the rest of their lives). Then
  there''s a bizarre initiation ceremony that mostly seems to involve kids beating
  each other up and paintball. Throughout the ephebic shenanigans, we find out that
  Tris is <i>good</i> at things, even though she''s skinny and female. Shocking, no?<br/><br/>What''s
  going on in the world? How did Lake Michigan turn into a marsh? Who has survived
  whatever apocalypse happened outside of Chicago? Who knows. Instead, we focus on
  the important things, like tattoos and stuff. The world building is secondary, and
  filled with all sorts of inconsistencies. For instance, they have the technology
  to induce crazy hallucinations and output brain activity to a monitor in real time,
  and without any sort of measuring device (if you know anything about how the brain
  works, feel free to laugh out loud at the implausibility), but they''re somehow
  unable to bring the CTA trains to a full stop at the stations. Say what?<br/><br/>Side
  note: as a Chicagoan, I must say that it''s unlikely that the CTA buses would still
  be running after some sort of cataclysmic, world-changing event. I mean, they don''t
  even come as often as they''re supposed to after 10pm. Sometimes they do that thing
  where no buses come for 20 minutes, then two come in a row, which never makes any
  sense to me. If I had a dollar for every time I''ve waited much longer than necessary
  for a bus from the Target on Peterson back to the red line, I''d definitely have
  enough money to take a cab instead. More unlikely is the idea that the city of Chicago
  would ever be run by a faction of incorruptible, selfless people. Cute.<br/><br/>Back
  to the review: this book definitely deserves only one star, based on sheer implausibility.
  But I am fickle, and I like to be entertained, even at the expense of a book that
  takes itself far too seriously. For that it gets an additional star. Now, if you
  excuse me, I have to get back to my gothic horror novel filled with mysterious women
  bathed in moonlight, because that book makes a lot more sense.'
