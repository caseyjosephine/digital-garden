My Review: 'I really wanted to like this. Not because it''s by J.K. Rowling, although
  I do respect her as a person, and I think that she writes well. I wanted to like
  it because it sounds like the kind of book I would like: set in an idyllic small
  town, where everything is not what it seems. I wanted to like it, but I didn''t.
  I couldn''t. The entire thing was insipid and uninspired.<br/><br/>One major problem
  was that Rowling didn''t know what kind of book she wanted to write. It wasn''t
  clear whether she intended this to be scathing social commentary, or a realistic
  portrait of a small town. I wasn''t sure whether she wanted us to love the characters,
  or love to hate them. Worse, though, was the fact that this book was fairly plotless,
  but not particularly character-focused, and with sparkly writing. It didn''t have
  much to recommend it.<br/><br/>While I hate to compare this to Harry Potter, I feel
  that I must. For me, the beautiful thing about Harry Potter was the J.K. Rowling
  created a world where the magical felt familiar. In most fantasy worlds, I always
  feel that I''m looking in on a world that is not comparable to my own. Harry Potter
  felt real and magical at the same time. Pagford, the fictional world in which The
  Casual Vacancy is set, feels similarly real, but I question the effectiveness of
  making the real world feel real. I have to live in the real world all the time,
  and I know what it''s like. I wish Rowling had philosophized about the real world,
  like [a:Leo Tolstoy|128382|Leo Tolstoy|http://photo.goodreads.com/authors/1342945438p2/128382.jpg],
  or made fun of it, like [a:Oscar Wilde|3565|Oscar Wilde|http://photo.goodreads.com/authors/1316521008p2/3565.jpg]
  and her (supposed, although I don''t see it) inspiration [a:Anthony Trollope|20524|Anthony
  Trollope|http://photo.goodreads.com/authors/1199114248p2/20524.jpg]. However, she
  didn''t seem to have anything interesting to say about the real world. I would have
  preferred a little magic.'
