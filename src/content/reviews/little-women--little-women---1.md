My Review: 'It''s my general conviction that every young woman (and most grown-up
  women) who fancies herself an outcast from the popular set and dreams of someday
  writing the great American novel identifies with Jo March. Sure, she takes wine
  "only medicinally," which is a sentiment I cannot abide. Plus, she considers herself
  "old" at 30, and she''s surprisingly uncritical of the patriarchal society that
  she ineffectually rebels against. However, Jo March, temperance aside, remains the
  best reason to read Little Women.<br/><br/>If the 1994 film is to be believed, the
  moral of the story is to write from the heart, because writing for money won''t
  get you anywhere. Given that Louisa May Alcott wrote Little Women to make a quick
  buck, this sentiment feels amusingly ironic. Like Jane Austen, Alcott recognized
  that financial security frees women from debasing themselves by thinking too much
  of money. Mrs. March pays lip service to the idea that it is better to be poor and
  happy than rich and unhappy; however, Alcott''s message is not that mo'' money means
  mo'' problems. Certainly, the best thing to be is rich and happy, like dear Teddy
  Laurence.<br/><br/>Reading this as an adult for the first time is an entirely different
  experience, I assume, from reading it as a child. Expect to be preached to, but
  in the most heartwarming way possible. Expect many mentions of "that heavenly friend,"
  especially during the first half of the book. Expect to be bored with vacuous, sanctimonious
  Beth (seriously, Beth talks about how "dumb" and unambitious she is throughout the
  entire book, and everyone else talks about how marvelous she is. 21st century mind
  cannot compute these data). My advice: read it with a glass of (non-medicinal) wine
  and the happy knowledge that times, undeniably, have changed.'
