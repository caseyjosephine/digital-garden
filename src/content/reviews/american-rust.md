My Review: 'What happens to small Pennsylvania steel town after the steel mill shuts
  down? How do the people who once had a good life, with security and benefits, cope?
  American Rust deals with this: the American Dream, and its failure. What’s interesting
  is that the characters in this book don’t pine for the life that left them behind.
  Instead, they become resigned, they hope for nothing more. Take this quote, for
  example.<br/><br/>“He had slept through life, let the currents take him. He had
  let the currents take him faster and faster and he had not noticed.”<br/><br/>The
  main conflict in American Rust comes from a murder; that alone is enough to suck
  you in and keep you turning the pages. There’s more to it then that, though. Through
  a grisly (but somehow unsurprising) event in a small town, author Philipp Meyer
  explores blue collar America, and the (limited) ways out. There’s football, and
  there’s college, but neither are guarantees. Take, for example, Lee, a character
  who leaves for Yale. At one point in the book, she feels “an incredible isolation,
  a suspicion she''d always had, she didn''t belong anywhere, she was going to outlive
  everyone she knew. She was going to be alone, the same as her mother. ” <br/><br/>Which
  resonated with me, because I get it. I don’t belong, either, in my small town, filled
  with the people who have settled for life the way it has been handed to them. But
  I also find it hard to fit in with the people who have hometowns worth going back
  to, populated with pleasant, educated people who are just like them. I can try to
  be one of them, and most of the time I fake it pretty well. But I have to try too
  hard. Eventually, people see right through me, down to the rural little girl who
  didn’t dream much bigger than living closer to the ocean.<br/><br/>The most liked
  quote from this book on Goodreads is the following “You ought to be able to grow
  up in a place and not have to get the hell out of it when you turn eighteen.” Anyone
  who finds themselves nodding their head in agreement will connect deeply with this
  book. And anyone who doesn’t should also read it, just to see how lucky they are.'
