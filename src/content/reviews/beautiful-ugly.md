Beautiful Ugly is an atmospheric and entertaining popcorn thriller that doesn't overstay its welcome. It requires a healthy suspension of disbelief, especially when it comes to how humans behave in both normal and abnormal situations. However, despite its (many) flaws it's fun in a schlocky "I'm going to roll my eyes now but I'm also going to keep turning the pages" sort of way.<br/><br/>The writing is mostly not good, occasionally stumbling into serviceable. It won't impress a discerning reader, nor does it care to be impressive. The twists kept coming in a way that felt like a parody of one of Steve Jobs' keynote speeches, where there's always "one more thing" behind the curtain. <br/><br/>I enjoyed turning off my brain and reading this in two sittings on a rainy holiday.
