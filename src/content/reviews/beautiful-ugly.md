My Review: 'Beautiful Ugly is an atmospheric and entertaining popcorn thriller that
  doesn''t overstay its welcome. It requires a healthy suspension of disbelief, especially
  when it comes to how humans behave in both normal and abnormal situations. However,
  despite its (many) flaws it''s fun in a schlocky "I''m going to roll my eyes now
  but I''m also going to keep turning the pages" sort of way.<br/><br/>The writing
  is mostly not good, occasionally stumbling into serviceable. It won''t impress a
  discerning reader, nor does it care to be impressive. The twists kept coming in
  a way that felt like a parody of one of Steve Jobs'' keynote speeches, where there''s
  always "one more thing" behind the curtain. <br/><br/>I enjoyed turning off my brain
  and reading this in two sittings on a rainy holiday. '
