My Review: 'Well, this started out strong. <br/><br/>At the beginning of Red Rising,
  we follow our young protagonist, Darrow, into the mines of Mars. Something not so
  awesome seems to have happened in this society and, to put it mildly, the Martian
  Dream doesn''t seem like all it''s cracked up to be. But, in science fiction, things
  are never what they seem, and it''s always up to the unlikely youngster to save
  the world. Joseph Campbell would be proud. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, after setting
  up a strong conflict, Pierce Brown abruptly shifts into a secondary plot, in which
  he can set up our young Darrow to be inexplicably awesome at everything. And yeah,
  I know, I could easily accuse Rothfuss of doing the same thing, but the difference
  is that the secondary plot of Red Rising, which becomes the primary plot, just isn''t
  that interesting. It''s a lot of ploty plot plot, with all sorts of Ploty McPlotersons
  doing a lot of ploty plot stuff. <br/><br/>I''ll likely continue the series, as
  I really was intrigued by the main premise. However, I''m not exactly champing at
  the bit to start the next book. '
