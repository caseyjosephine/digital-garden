My Review: '[a:Jo Nesbø|904719|Jo Nesbø|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1313316680p2/904719.jpg]
  is known for his critically acclaimed, masterfully crafted series of mystery novels
  centered around alcoholic detective Harry Hole. The Bat, the first of the Hole books,
  is not quite so well known, nor is it masterfully crafted. In translating his work
  into English, it seems that his publishers may have tried to sweep the first two
  books in the series under the rug. Clearly, Nesbø didn''t make a splash with a dazzling
  literary debut. The Bat feels as if it has been written by an author still in the
  shallow end of the pool, inching in slowly. If there''s any genius in this book,
  I can''t see it.<br/><br/>I knew this all going in, of course. But I am somewhat
  meticulous in my reading, and I cannot abide beginning a story in the middle. So,
  I started here. The Bat follows Norwegian detective Harry Hole (pronounced somewhat
  like Holy) to Sydney, Australia, where a young Norwegian woman has been murdered.
  Investigations ensue, with an interesting supporting cast: an Aboriginal officer,
  Andrew, an ostentatious transvestite, Otto, and (naturally) a seductive Swede, Birgitta.<br/><br/>The
  "fish out of water" setup didn''t work well for me: there''s something disingenuous
  about hearing the plight of indigenous Australians coming from a Norwegian. That''s
  not to say that outsiders can''t have opinions, I just never got the idea that Nesbø
  was particularly invested in Australia. Tellingly, the next novel, set in Thailand,
  was the last to be translated. My guess is that middling mystery novels written
  by Norwegians but set abroad are a hard sell.<br/><br/>Anyway, this doesn''t sound
  like a particularly positive review, and I guess it''s not. But I do plan on reading
  the rest of the books in the series, and I look forward to the third, which is supposed
  to be exceptional. '
