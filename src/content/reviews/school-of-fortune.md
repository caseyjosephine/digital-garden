My Review: Pippa Walker is an oil-heiress whose mother is planning the wedding of
  the century. Unfortunately for Pippa, the wedding backfires and she is cast out
  of the family. Now she must complete a degree in order to receive her trust fund,
  but this is easier said than done. <br/><br/>Full of zany antics and over-the-top
  characters, School of Fortune is a fun chick-lit read. I bought the book in the
  airport on the way from Los Angeles to London, and was able to stay entertained
  for the 12 hour flight. It may be chick-lit, but its got heart, spunk and enough
  insane situations to keep the pages turning until the very end.
