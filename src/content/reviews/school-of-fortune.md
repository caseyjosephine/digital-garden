Pippa Walker is an oil-heiress whose mother is planning the wedding of the century. Unfortunately for Pippa, the wedding backfires and she is cast out of the family. Now she must complete a degree in order to receive her trust fund, but this is easier said than done. <br/><br/>Full of zany antics and over-the-top characters, School of Fortune is a fun chick-lit read. I bought the book in the airport on the way from Los Angeles to London, and was able to stay entertained for the 12 hour flight. It may be chick-lit, but its got heart, spunk and enough insane situations to keep the pages turning until the very end.
