My Review: 'Ugh, this book. It sounds pretty interesting, right? A mother and child
  are held captive in a room, which is the only place the poor child has ever known.
  The story is told from his perspective. But, you know what? Sometimes people with
  interesting ideas are terrible, terrible writers. If Stephen King had written this,
  it probably would have been terrifying and compelling and awesome (not that I think
  of King as, like, a paragon of good writing, but he''s about ten thousand times
  more capable than Donoghue).<br/><br/>Here''s the thing that bothered me: the child
  narrator is question is not believable as a child, or as a narrator, or even really
  as a human. He makes errors in speech that no child would make, typically developing
  or otherwise, but then he is somehow capable of reading Alice and Wonderland and
  talking about how things are agonizing. I think Donoghue was trying to make the
  kid sound realistic, but she really just made him sound like a full-grown adult
  trying to write like a child. And there''s over three hundred pages of his narration.
  Seriously. That''s three hours of my life that I''ll never get back.<br/><br/>But,
  if that wasn''t enough, there''s all sorts of preachiness about Jesus, and heaven
  and faith. Also, weird moralistic lessons about living with less, which felt out
  of place because we probably shouldn''t try to live as if we''ve been stuck in a
  shed with only the barest essentials for seven freaking years. The only positive
  thing I can say is that it''s slightly better than Divergent, but it''s definitely
  worse than anything else I''ve read this year. Now if you excuse me, I''m going
  to go read some Calvino in an attempt to wash the bad taste of this book out of
  my brain.'
