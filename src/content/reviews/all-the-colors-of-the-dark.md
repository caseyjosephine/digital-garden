My Review: 'I shouldn''t have believed the hype. <br/><br/>A good mystery will keep
  me turning the pages late into the night, but this wasn''t a good mystery. I''m
  willing to overlook pacing issues when the writing is excellent, but this was a
  bunch of purple prose. Multifaceted characters will cover up a multitude of sins,
  but these characters were roughly-cut gemstones with little color and poor clarity.
  <br/><br/>The worst thing about All the Colors of the Dark: all the action takes
  place off-page! The author will spend page after page (or should I say chapter after
  chapter, since the chapters were obnoxiously short) writing descriptions full of
  sound and fury, signifying nothing. Exit, pursued by a bear. Then, in the next chapter,
  the main character is in the middle of serving a prison sentence for committing
  bear-related crimes. <br/><br/>Whitaker writes as if it''s clever to leave out plot-critical
  scenes and force the reader to say "hey, did I miss something?" There will be no
  further explanation. There is only exasperation.<br/><br/>Realistically, this should
  garner a two-star rating, but I can see glimmers of brilliance here and there. Still,
  I can''t recommend this book—unless you''re interested in mentally polishing a raw
  mess into a diamond. '
