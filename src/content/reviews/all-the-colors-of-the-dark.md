I shouldn't have believed the hype. <br/><br/>A good mystery will keep me turning the pages late into the night, but this wasn't a good mystery. I'm willing to overlook pacing issues when the writing is excellent, but this was a bunch of purple prose. Multifaceted characters will cover up a multitude of sins, but these characters were roughly-cut gemstones with little color and poor clarity. <br/><br/>The worst thing about All the Colors of the Dark: all the action takes place off-page! The author will spend page after page (or should I say chapter after chapter, since the chapters were obnoxiously short) writing descriptions full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Exit, pursued by a bear. Then, in the next chapter, the main character is in the middle of serving a prison sentence for committing bear-related crimes. <br/><br/>Whitaker writes as if it's clever to leave out plot-critical scenes and force the reader to say "hey, did I miss something?" There will be no further explanation. There is only exasperation.<br/><br/>Realistically, this should garner a two-star rating, but I can see glimmers of brilliance here and there. Still, I can't recommend this bookâ€”unless you're interested in mentally polishing a raw mess into a diamond.
