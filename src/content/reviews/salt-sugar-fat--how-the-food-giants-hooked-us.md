My Review: 'Go into a typical American grocery store, and you won''t find that they
  stock much food. The real food lines the edges: produce, meat and seafood, dairy.
  If you want real food that was produced locally and sustainably, with care paid
  to proper animal-husbandry practices, you''re probably out of luck entirely. The
  interior of the store is filled with food products: mostly nutrient-poor corn and
  soy based "foods" engineered to make you keep reaching for just one more. These
  products are heavily marketed towards children.<br/><br/>Let''s take a look at the
  ingredient list for Cheetos, which is available online but are not able to be copied
  and pasted because Frito-Lay seems to want to keep this information as secret as
  possible. Spoiler alert: this stuff is pretty much poison. My comments on the ingredients
  appear as footnotes.<br/><br/>Enriched Corn Meal [1] (Corn Meal, Ferrous Sulfate,
  Niacin, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, and Folic Acid), Vegetable Oil [2] (Corn,
  Canola, and/or Sunflower Oil), Cheese Seasoning (Whey, Cheddar Cheese [Milk, Cheese
  Cultures, Salt, Enzymes], Canola Oil [3], Maltodextrin [Made From Corn] [4], Salt,
  Whey Protein Concentrate, Monosodium Glutamate [5], Natural and Artificial Flavors
  [6], Lactic Acid, Citric Acid [7], Artificial Color [Yellow 6] [8]), and Salt.<br/><br/>Cheetos
  were the first food product I could think of, but many food products have similar
  ingredients. Seriously, the crap that lines the grocery store shelves is mostly
  corn with artificial flavorings. I wouldn''t feed most of these products to anyone,
  but millions of people are buying them for their children. How the hell did this
  happen?<br/><br/>Salt Sugar Fat attempts to provide an answer, by detailing a historical
  account of processed food. The first section, Sugar, explains how we''ve gone from
  healthy breakfast standards like eggs, bacon, and sausage, to eating bowls of glorified
  sugar for breakfast. It''s incredibly disturbing, especially when you hear how food
  companies go about creating and marketing these products. Unbelievably, many cereals
  make claims about their "healthy whole grains"(which aren''t even particularly healthy)
  even though their cereals are pretty much 50% sugar.<br/><br/>Case in point: the
  insane claim that Frosted Mini Wheats "boost brain power." <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/05/30/187330235/no-frosted-mini-wheats-don-t-make-your-kids-smarter">Check
  it out</a>. This is all based on in-house studies, and they didn''t even do a good
  job biasing the studies because the data don''t support the claims, but that didn''t
  stop the food companies from marketing sugary wheat as a health product. Seriously,
  you can''t make this shit up.<br/><br/>The fat section is a bit more uneven than
  the sugar section. See, sugar is something that pretty clearly has no nutritional
  value and shouldn''t be a major part of anyone''s diet. Fat, on the other hand,
  is more complicated. Moss writes based on the misconception that polyunsaturated
  fats are healthy and that saturated fats should be avoided at all costs, which is
  outdated (the true story is much more nuanced than that, and really depends on whether
  you''re getting your saturated fat from grass fed cows or from processed foods).
  This grated on me. However, the kinds of fats he''s talking about are processed
  fats, so my nit-picking isn''t terribly relevant, because no one thinks processed
  cheese and trans fats are healthy.<br/><br/>I didn''t realize how much cheese people
  were eating. See, Americans have decided that whole milk is, like, super bad for
  them; apparently, they''ve traded milk consumption for seriously excessive amounts
  of cheese consumption. Moss outlines how cheese turned from something to be enjoyed
  in moderation with a little charcuterie and wine, to an ingredient that can be used
  in a ton of different products (on the cheap, of course). This is mostly due to
  some incredibly insane government subsidies that lead to more milk being produced
  than the market needed, or even wanted. You''ll never look at that box of Mac and
  "Cheese" (really, cheese product) again. <br/><br/>The final section, Salt, deals
  with the truly insane amounts of salt put into processed foods. People seem to know
  that salt can be damaging in large quantities, but the "solution" has been removing
  the salt shaker and eating bland food at home. Truth is, if you''re making food
  from scratch, you don''t really need to worry about the amount of salt you''re consuming.
  The major issue is the sodium in processed foods, which contributes to the texture
  and covers up off flavors, like the "warmed over flavor" that comes from oxidized
  food products. Without salt, processed foods taste completely disgusting, so don''t
  expect to see truly low-sodium versions of these foods in the future. <br/><br/>I''m
  subtracting one star, because processed foods are deeply connected to science, which
  Moss does not write about well. As a scientist myself, it pains me to see descriptions
  like this one about "brain imaging, which allowed [Nestlé] to perform <i>nifty</i>
  experiments like wiring the scalps of its human test subjects to EEG machines in
  order to see how, say, Dreyer''s ice cream…<i>excites the brain''s neurology</i>"
  (emphasis added). Read that again, because it''s terrible. EEG measures electrical
  signals that indicate neuronal activity in the brain. Neurology is a brach of medicine
  that deals with nervous system disorders. The book includes many errors like this,
  although more often Moss fails to include any sort of methodological information
  at all. Of course, if Americans were more science literate, we wouldn''t need books
  like this in the first place.<br/><br/>My criticisms aside, I would definitely recommend
  this book, especially for people who are newer to healthy eating. <br/><br/>[1]
  Made from genetically modified corn, although they don''t have to say that on the
  label on the label, and grown in a monoculture that''s incredibly harmful to the
  environment<br/><br/>[2] A chemically extracted, terribly unhealthy oil that''s
  been touted as healthier than good old-fashioned butter (if this sounds surprising
  to you, I highly encourage you to check out <a href="http://rawfoodsos.com/2010/07/07/the-china-study-fact-or-fallac/">this
  debunking of the China Study</a>, as well as the wonderfully accessible book Real
  Food, which explains the sound nutritional advice of the <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org">Weston
  A. Price Foundation.</a> Besides being horrible for you, most vegetable oils are
  genetically modified.<br/><br/>[3] Why Canola oil would be added to cheese, I have
  no idea, as cheese naturally contains a fair amount of milk fat<br/><br/>[4] Maltodextrin
  is a type of sugar<br/><br/>[5] Yep, that''s MSG<br/><br/>[6] Both "natural" and
  artificial flavorings are created in labs; "natural" products aren''t particularly
  natural, but they''re made from things you might find in nature, ish. <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-difference-be-2002-07-29">This
  Scientific American article</a> explains it well.<br/><br/>[7] Lactic Acid and Citric
  Acid both act as preservatives<br/><br/>[8] This is manufactured from petroleum,
  and is a carcinogen. Yummy.'
