My Review: 'Race in America is woven into the fabric of the country: it’s difficult
  to imagine our lives without it. Of course, some claim that they don’t notice race,
  or that racism doesn’t exist (they would be wrong on both counts). However, most
  people hold race as this rarefied, natural thing, as if Africans from Lagos to Addis
  Ababa spend a ton of time thinking about themselves as black (with the underlying
  expectation that they compare themselves to those who are White).<br/><br/>Americanah
  is interesting, in that it examines race in America from the point of view of a
  woman who moved from Nigeria to the US and became black. To wit:<br/><br/>“The only
  reason you say that race was not an issue is because you wish it was not. We all
  wish it was not. But it’s a lie. I came from a country where race was not an issue;
  I did not think of myself as black and I only became black when I came to America.”<br/><br/>Americanah
  chronicles the story of Ifemelu, a middle class Niegerian woman, from her childhood
  in Lagos to college in Philadelphia, her post-college life in Baltimore, New Haven,
  and Princeton, and her ultimate decision to move back to Lagos. It has the feel
  of a sweeping epic, but sometimes the narrative falls flat. Adichie sometimes writes
  sections from the point of view of Ifemelu’s lover, Obinze, but these never feel
  like quite enough. The story also drags a bit after the return to Nigeria: I kept
  finding myself asking “Is this book over yet?” which is never a good sign. <br/><br/>Perhaps
  most stylistically interesting is Adichie’s decision to include Ifemelu’s blog posts
  on race in American (from the point of view of a non-American Black). I can’t decide
  whether the included blog posts are a clever device for adding relevant short essays
  that fall outside the narrative scope of the novel, or a lazy method to weave in
  issues that aren’t full realized in the narrative structure. Overall, I think it
  mostly works, and I’m curious to see whether other authors pick up the idea of metablogging
  in the future.<br/><br/>Despite its shortcomings, Americanah just seems to work.
  Adichie manages to write with a somewhat florid style that never seems obnoxious
  or precious, which I enjoyed. I also learned quite a bit about Nigeria, which was
  a bonus. I recommend this to anyone who’s interested in race and the immigrant experience,
  and I’m looking forward to reading more of Adichie’s work.'
