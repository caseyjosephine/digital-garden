You know how, occasionally, at a barbecue or other similar social gathering, someone will maliciously bring a bag of Cheetos Puffs? And you know that eating them is a terrible, terrible idea: I mean, the tasty facade is mostly just cheesy, and below that they're pretty much made up of nonsense. But this strange force grips you and compels you towards the puffs. The first one goes down easy, so you grab another, and then another, and then another. You want to stop, but you keep saying to yourself "just one more." <br/><br/>What happens is, by the end of the night, you've finished the bag. Of course, you feel completely ashamed of yourself, but also strangely satisfied. After all, everyone needs a little cheese covered nonsense in their lives, at least from time to time.<br/><br/>Reading a Dan Brown novel is pretty much exactly like that. Minus the orange fingers.
