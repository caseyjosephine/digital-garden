Get ready to suspend your disbelief, because the plot of The Secret History is outlandish, to say the least. A group of Classics students gets into some trouble following an incident during some Bacchanalian activities. And I mean Bacchanalian in the most literal sense of the world, à la Sebastiano Ricci:<br/><br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/c7ux1ou.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com" /><br/><br/>(See, I can make cultural references too. Being set at a college, and being written by a 28 year old, The Secret History sometimes goes eye-rollingly over the top with references that are supposed to be impressive, but mostly make one feel as if one is taking part in a pseudo-intellectual circle jerk. I think this kind of stuff is only effective when Joyce does it, but <i>à chacun son goût</i>.)<br/><br/>Anyway, combine a bacchanal, intensely dislikable characters, bad decisions, classical references, and lots of blow, and you've got The Secret History. It's more or less [b:Crime and Punishment|7144|Crime and Punishment|Fyodor Dostoyevsky|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1382846449s/7144.jpg|3393917] with sophomoric upper-class hipsters. The major problem is that Tartt seems to write them as if they really were the cognoscenti, which prevents her from adding in any <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7VgNQbZdaw">humor about how ridiculous they are</a>.<br/><br/>The Secret History came out in 1992, when this year's college graduates were still gestating and [a:Bret Easton Ellis|2751|Bret Easton Ellis|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1274408405p2/2751.jpg] was still relevant; as you can imagine, it doesn't display the maturity of [b:The Goldfinch|17333223|The Goldfinch|Donna Tartt|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1378710146s/17333223.jpg|24065147]. However, it's a pretty fun ride, if you're into this sort of thing.
