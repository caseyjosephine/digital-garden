My Review: Get ready to suspend your disbelief, because the plot of The Secret History
  is outlandish, to say the least. A group of Classics students gets into some trouble
  following an incident during some Bacchanalian activities. And I mean Bacchanalian
  in the most literal sense of the world, à la Sebastiano Ricci:<br/><br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/c7ux1ou.jpg"
  title="Hosted by imgur.com" /><br/><br/>(See, I can make cultural references too.
  Being set at a college, and being written by a 28 year old, The Secret History sometimes
  goes eye-rollingly over the top with references that are supposed to be impressive,
  but mostly make one feel as if one is taking part in a pseudo-intellectual circle
  jerk. I think this kind of stuff is only effective when Joyce does it, but <i>à
  chacun son goût</i>.)<br/><br/>Anyway, combine a bacchanal, intensely dislikable
  characters, bad decisions, classical references, and lots of blow, and you've got
  The Secret History. It's more or less [b:Crime and Punishment|7144|Crime and Punishment|Fyodor
  Dostoyevsky|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1382846449s/7144.jpg|3393917]
  with sophomoric upper-class hipsters. The major problem is that Tartt seems to write
  them as if they really were the cognoscenti, which prevents her from adding in any
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7VgNQbZdaw">humor about how ridiculous
  they are</a>.<br/><br/>The Secret History came out in 1992, when this year's college
  graduates were still gestating and [a:Bret Easton Ellis|2751|Bret Easton Ellis|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1274408405p2/2751.jpg]

  However, it's a pretty fun ride, if you're into this sort of thing.
