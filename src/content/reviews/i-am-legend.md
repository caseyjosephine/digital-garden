This little novella is freaking awesome. It's a story about vampires (real vampires, the scary kind. Not the kind that sparkle and bang teenagers.), but it's much more than a story about vampires. Indeed, it's an honest look at loneliness, drive, alcoholism, and what it actually feels like to be the last person alive on Earth.
