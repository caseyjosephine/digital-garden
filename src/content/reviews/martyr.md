My Review: 'This feels like a spiritual successor to Wise Blood in the best possible
  way. It''s a character study in a series of vignettes that waste no time getting
  under your skin. It treats religion, and religious trauma, with a sense of morbid
  curiosity. <br/><br/>Martyr! manages to tackle big concepts, like what it means
  to live and die as a human being, but it does so by examining seemingly mundane,
  workaday moments. <br/><br/>To wit, Kaveh Akbar describes the blue of a character''s
  eyes as "the kind of blue many blond people''s eyes are. So common you forget how
  pretty they are. Like pigeons."<br/><br/>This was a gorgeous book. All the stars.
  I''d say I''d die for it but that''s a little on the nose. '
