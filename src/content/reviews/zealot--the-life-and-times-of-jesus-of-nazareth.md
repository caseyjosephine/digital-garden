My Review: Although Reza Aslan titled his book Zealot, it could just as easily have
  been called "A Tale of Two Jesuses." The first Jesus is the one that many Americans
  are familiar with; I first learned about him during Catholic Catechism. He's the
  literal son of God, born of a literal virgin, which is why he gets to walk around
  with that glowing crown of gold around his head. He's all about doing unto others
  as you would have them do unto you, and all that. He looks like this:<br/><br/><a
  href="http://imgur.com/aP9eHOV"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aP9eHOV.png" title="Hosted
  by imgur.com" /></a><br/><br/>Historical Jesus is pretty freaking different from
  Catholic Jesus. First of all, he's never considers himself the literal son of God,
  nor does he even refer to himself as the Messiah. He's not some divine being sent
  to earth to bring us salvation in another life. Instead, historical Jesus wanted
  to bring the Jewish people prosperity during his own time.<br/><br/>Consider this
  "Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I have not come to bring
  peace, but the sword" (Matthew 10:34, Luke 12:51).<br/><br/>I definitely prefer
  historical Jesus to Catholic Jesus. Historical Jesus was an iconoclast who devoted
  his life to overturning an unjust social order during one of the most tumultuous
  periods in history. Historical Jesus was a complete badass. I imagine that Historical
  Jesus looked something like this:<br/><br/><a href="http://imgur.com/KH9Jgew"><img
  src="http://i.imgur.com/KH9Jgew.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com"/></a><br/><br/>Zealot
  is a short book, but it outlined quite a bit about the historical context that totally
  blew my mind. For example, purification acts performed at the temple in Jerusalem
  were a major source of income for Rome, so when Jesus cured lepers he was actively
  taking away this income. Also, Jesus wasn't the only potential messiah running around.
  In reality, he had a fair amount of competition. <br/><br/>There are some places
  where this book gets weird, like the part where Aslan doesn't dismiss out of hand
  the idea that Jesus performed miracles. Instead, he just talks about how some people
  said that Jesus was performing miracles, and others said that it was magic. Um,
  okay? David Blaine performs "magic" too, but his tricks have physical (as opposed
  to metaphysical) explanations, because we live in a world governed by the laws of
  physics. Unfortunately, magic isn't real (there are tons of kids who didn't get
  a letter from Hogwarts on their 13th birthday, who also didn't wake up levitating
  on their 16th birthday, who will attest to this fact). Miracles don't exist either,
  unless we're talking about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs">magnets</a>.
  The historical record might suggest that Jesus was particularly good at sleight
  of hand tricks, which made it appear that he performed magicles, but that doesn't
  mean he actually did. Occam's Razor, etc. It's kind of silly to boil that all down
  to a question of semantics. A true historian would be appropriately incredulous.
  <br/><br/>The book is also short and ends abruptly, far before I felt like I was
  finished with it, almost as if<br/><br/>Still, I do recommend this book, to religious
  and non-religious people alike. I came out of it with a greater appreciation for
  Jesus, the man. Where I stand on the position of the Jesus, the Christ, remains
  unchanged. I pity the fool who tries to convert me by appealing to Jesus, the ethereal
  archetype. I've now got some pretty persuasive arguments against that particular
  viewpoint.
