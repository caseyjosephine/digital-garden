My Review: 'Oh Jane Austen, you never cease to be charming, do you? In Northanger
  Abbey, the brilliant Miss Austen manages to lampoon Gothic novels <i>and</i> produce
  her typical story of upper-crust society shenanigans, which ends up being ridiculously
  enjoyable.<br/><br/>Her heroine, Catherine Morland, is a teenage girl who has had
  her (rather subpar) brain ruined by the voracious reading of novels, a la [b:Don

  And yes, dear Catherine really is stupid, as she fails to pick up on any of the
  social subtleties present in her particular milieu. This idiocy comes to a head
  when she leaves Bath for Northanger Abbey, where she manages to come up with all
  manner of unlikely explanations for perfectly ordinary behaviors. Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/><img

  this novel.<br/><br/>4 stars, because, while Austen manages to be quite as funny
  as always, she''s not particularly scathing. Which is too bad, because I like scathing

  is my favorite of Austen''s novels, and not only because I''m also 27 and, thus,
  probably a washed up old maid). And the ending kind of hit me in the face, as if
  Austen was like "Ok, gotta finish this real quick so I can go to the ball!" '
