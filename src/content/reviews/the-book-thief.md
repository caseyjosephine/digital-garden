My Review: 'A beautiful story, diminished only by the inclusion of death as narrator,
  which felt like a gimmick. However, I can overlock gimmicks in young adult fiction,
  and it seems that many people liked this particular gimmick anyway.<br/><br/>Highly
  recommended, especially for younger teens. '
