My Review: 'The Golden Compass was my hundredth and, unless I manage to read another
  book in the three and a half hours until midnight, final book of 2014. It''s been
  a rough year, and when I initially picked this up I was looking for brain candy
  to escape reality for awhile. No such luck: while The Golden Compass purports to
  be a book for children, Pullman doesn''t shy away from grown-up conflicts. The Golden
  Compass serves as a reminder, to kids and adults, that we have to take the good
  with the bad. We can''t escape from reality; indeed, trying to can be more dangerous
  than facing it head on.<br/><br/>The Golden Compass is set in an alternate reality
  where religious dogma dominates politics, where scientific findings are twisted
  and manipulated to fit into a religious agenda. In this bleak landscape, the evil,
  power-hungry Mrs. Coulter haunts the dreams of children:<br/><br/><a href="http://imgur.com/aIz10OW"><img
  src="http://i.imgur.com/aIz10OW.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br/><br/>In
  other words, it''s set in a world not so different from our own.<br/><br/>I can''t
  do the plot justice in this review, and I don''t want to try. I will say that I
  tore through it, and I''m looking forward to reading The Subtle Knife. With the
  rest of the series to look forward to, 2015 is looking better and better.'
