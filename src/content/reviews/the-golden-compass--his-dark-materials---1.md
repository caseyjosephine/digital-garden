The Golden Compass was my hundredth and, unless I manage to read another book in the three and a half hours until midnight, final book of 2014. It's been a rough year, and when I initially picked this up I was looking for brain candy to escape reality for awhile. No such luck: while The Golden Compass purports to be a book for children, Pullman doesn't shy away from grown-up conflicts. The Golden Compass serves as a reminder, to kids and adults, that we have to take the good with the bad. We can't escape from reality; indeed, trying to can be more dangerous than facing it head on.<br/><br/>The Golden Compass is set in an alternate reality where religious dogma dominates politics, where scientific findings are twisted and manipulated to fit into a religious agenda. In this bleak landscape, the evil, power-hungry Mrs. Coulter haunts the dreams of children:<br/><br/><a href="http://imgur.com/aIz10OW"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aIz10OW.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br/><br/>In other words, it's set in a world not so different from our own.<br/><br/>I can't do the plot justice in this review, and I don't want to try. I will say that I tore through it, and I'm looking forward to reading The Subtle Knife. With the rest of the series to look forward to, 2015 is looking better and better.
