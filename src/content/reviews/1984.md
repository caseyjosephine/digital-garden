Half a century after it was written, and more than twenty years after the events were supposed to take place, George Orwell's 1984 remains a gripping look at the world that still might be. It's hard to see this dystopia as pure speculation, especially when news stations today act as propaganda, and citizens are under constant surveillance. While slogans such as "War is Peace" seem perfectly oxymoronic, we can easily see connections with current events. <br/><br/>I would encourage everyone to read this novel with a critical eye to our own society. We are the only people who can stop a dystopia from coming to fruition.
