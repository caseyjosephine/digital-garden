My Review: 'The real horror story is how society treats vulnerable teenage girls.
  Thank you, Grady Hendrix, for being a dude that writes female characters well by
  treating them like people. I hope men pick up this book because it''s horror written
  by a dude, and I hope they learn something about the female experience. <br/><br/>Witchcraft
  for Wayward Girls reminded me quite a bit of Bright Young Women. They''re set during
  similar time periods, center around young women who aren''t taken seriously, and
  use the horror genre as a lens to examine feminist issues. They both get my highest
  recommendation, which means I recommended them to my mom. <br/><br/>In a world where
  the Neil Gaiman allegations are making me lose my faith in any man that loudly claims
  to be a feminist, reading Witchcraft for Wayward girls made me feel hope. The fight
  over reproductive rights matters, and there are men out there who get it. '
