The real horror story is how society treats vulnerable teenage girls. Thank you, Grady Hendrix, for being a dude that writes female characters well by treating them like people. I hope men pick up this book because it's horror written by a dude, and I hope they learn something about the female experience. <br/><br/>Witchcraft for Wayward Girls reminded me quite a bit of Bright Young Women. They're set during similar time periods, center around young women who aren't taken seriously, and use the horror genre as a lens to examine feminist issues. They both get my highest recommendation, which means I recommended them to my mom. <br/><br/>In a world where the Neil Gaiman allegations are making me lose my faith in any man that loudly claims to be a feminist, reading Witchcraft for Wayward girls made me feel hope. The fight over reproductive rights matters, and there are men out there who get it.
