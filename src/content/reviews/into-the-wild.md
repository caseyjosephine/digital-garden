My Review: 'This book left me feeling conflicted. It''s well written and thought-provoking:
  Krakauer''s fondness for the wild shines through each chapter. However, I haven''t
  encountered a more unlikable protagonist than the doomed hiker, Chris McCandless,
  since I read [b:On the Road|70401|On the Road|Jack Kerouac|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1355224265s/70401.jpg|1701188].
  There''s a parallel between the two books, with naive voyages across the country
  for some sort of unclear, grand purpose. McCandless reads as the type of person
  who cares more about long-dead authors than his own, loving parents. Krakauer repeatedly
  describes him as wildly intelligent, but the snatches of journal entires included
  in the book reveal a man who was rambling, incoherent, and unstable.<br/><br/>Towards
  the end of the book, Krakauer imbues in McCandless an individualistic false heroism:
  he seems to believe that McCandless could make the world a better place just by
  making himself a "better" (or, at the least, self-sufficient) person. However, giving
  away all your money is easy when you''ve always had enough, just like it''s easy
  to be brave when you consider yourself to be invincible. Krakauer is open about
  the fact that he identifies with McCandless, and this seems to have lead to a lack
  of objectivity in understanding just how reckless and naive McCandless was. At the
  end of the day, he wasn''t a hero as much as a risk-taking young man who bit off
  way more than he could chew.'
