My Review: 'The Happiness Project is a perfectly middling book about being happier
  through monthly projects. Each month, author Gretchen Rubin focuses on happiness
  by doing things like decluttering and not nagging her husband. Is this book worthy?
  Nope; it''s really just blog worthy. It''s not uninteresting, except that everything
  could be covered in about 5,000 words. Having it all unnecessarily written out into
  around 300 pages made it all seem annoyingly repetitive. By the sixth month of rich
  white people resolutions, getting through each practically-identical chapter felt
  like an almost Sisyphian task.<br/><br/>(Sidenote: Rubin reprints blog comments
  in pretty much every chapter, with no commentary or attribution. This really irked
  me. If I wanted to read the internet, I wouldn''t be reading a book.)<br/><br/>Speaking
  of rich white people problems: Rubin is rich and white. This mostly didn''t bother
  me, except for the parts where Rubin talked about "ordinary people" increasing their
  happiness. Being wealthy isn''t particularly ordinary, after all. And there was
  the money chapter, where Rubin concludes (against most empirical evidence) that
  money buys happiness. Great.<br/><br/>Any book that deals with peoples'' problems
  is going to be highly personalized. Rubin expends a lot of effort trying to nag
  and yell less. I sure have a lot of flaws, but not those ones, so I had a hard time
  caring about how hard it was for her to hold her tongue when someone bought the
  wrong lightbulbs. <br/><br/>Also, if you''re looking for a way to keep those health-related
  resolutions, look elsewhere. There''s only a teeny, tiny bit in here about food,
  which I found strange (my life mostly centers around food, so that would be a large
  part of any happiness project I did). At one point, Rubin talks about giving up
  "fake food," but then backpedals and talks about how much she likes Diet Coke (Diet
  Coke features all too often in this book). At one point, Rubin recounts a meal with
  a friend, a salad with no dressing sprinkled with artificial sweetener, which sounds
  unhealthy (where''s the protein? where''s the fat?) and disgusting.<br/><br/>Overall
  verdict: skip it or skim it, unless you''re really into this sort of book. '
