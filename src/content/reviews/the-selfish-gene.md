This book was recommended to me while I was working on a research project in Evolutionary Psychology at my university. Being a student in Psychology, I had background knowledge in evolution and natural selection, but this book changed the way I thought about evolutionary theory.<br/><br/>It may not be hard science (it is, after all, popular science writing), but it will open your eyes to different ways of thinking about genes and genomes. It's also a fun read, that can be read in a day (which is more than can be said for some dry and inexplicably long journal articles). If you are at all interested in biology, genetics, psychology, zoology or any of the life sciences, I highly recommend this book.
