My Review: This book was recommended to me while I was working on a research project
  in Evolutionary Psychology at my university. Being a student in Psychology, I had
  background knowledge in evolution and natural selection, but this book changed the
  way I thought about evolutionary theory.<br/><br/>It may not be hard science (it
  is, after all, popular science writing), but it will open your eyes to different
  ways of thinking about genes and genomes. It's also a fun read, that can be read
  in a day (which is more than can be said for some dry and inexplicably long journal
  articles). If you are at all interested in biology, genetics, psychology, zoology
  or any of the life sciences, I highly recommend this book.
