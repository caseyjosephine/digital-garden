Terrifying, heartbreaking, and hauntingly beautiful, this is a classic that everyone should read.<br/><br/>As a schoolgirl, I had the opportunity to hear an elderly Auschwitz survivor tell her story. Both parents and children were invited, and the audience was packed. At this point, I had read [b:The Diary of a Young Girl|48855|The Diary of a Young Girl|Anne Frank|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1358276407s/48855.jpg|3532896] and [b:Number the Stars|47281|Number the Stars|Lois Lowry|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1320431796s/47281.jpg|2677305], and I considered myself vaguely "interested in" the Holocaust. However, I was still a child, and the horror of what had happened did not become real to me until I heard this woman's voice, saw her tattoo, and noticed that my mother cried, silently, as we heard about the starvation, the labor, the cold.<br/><br/>When we left to go home, my mother remarked that my children would not be able to hear about life in a concentration camp from a survivor. Soon, there would be none left.<br/><br/>It heartens me to know that, when I do have children, I will be able to read this book to them. They will need to know what happened, they will need to know the terrible things that people have done to each other, can do to each other. Thank you, Elie Wiesel, for writing this book, so that the world will never forget.
