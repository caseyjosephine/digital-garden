My Review: 'This is a book about a teenage girl that constantly has to deal with supernatural
  creatures:<br/><br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5TILWqu.gifv"><br/><br/>She spends
  a lot of time hanging out with a werewolf:<br/><br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rIXDI3P.gifv"><br/><br/>She''s
  also desperate to bang her hot vampire boyfriend:<br/><br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nVtbFmZ.gifv"><br/><br/>Unfortunately,
  the only humor here comes from Bella''s extreme stupidity and the beautiful blandness
  of all her (tame) vampire friends. Anyway, this read like yet another fan-fiction
  version of a story that doesn''t exist, but not in a meta-fictional, Borges sort
  of way. '
