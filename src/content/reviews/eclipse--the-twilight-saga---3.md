This is a book about a teenage girl that constantly has to deal with supernatural creatures:<br/><br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5TILWqu.gifv"><br/><br/>She spends a lot of time hanging out with a werewolf:<br/><br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rIXDI3P.gifv"><br/><br/>She's also desperate to bang her hot vampire boyfriend:<br/><br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nVtbFmZ.gifv"><br/><br/>Unfortunately, the only humor here comes from Bella's extreme stupidity and the beautiful blandness of all her (tame) vampire friends. Anyway, this read like yet another fan-fiction version of a story that doesn't exist, but not in a meta-fictional, Borges sort of way.
