My Review: Well, that was even worse than I expected. I thought it would be a maudlin,
  guilty pleasure, but there was no pleasure at all (unless you count the occasional
  exasperated laughs that came out when the writing got particularly ridiculous).
  Picoult is so incapable of conveying <i>anything</i> through her writing that the
  only way the publisher could think to differentiate between the different narrators
  was to typeset their sections in different fonts. No joke.<br/><br/>If there's any
  point to this drivel, it's not the highfalutin moral one that I believe Picoult
  intends (I use the word "highfalutin" because I want to stick with simple words
  that Picoult would understand, though that's likely unnecessary as textual evidence
  suggests that Picoult isn't a big reader). Indeed, the only thing I got out of it
  was the recognition that life is way to short for this shit.
