My Review: The first lecture of my English 101 class was a life-changing experience
  for me. My professor started out by reading to us from the original Old English
  text of Beowulf. The round, warm, Germanic sounds of the language resonated throughout
  the hall, and although I couldn't understand the words, I felt something of the
  work that I'd never felt before.<br/><br/>I've read numerous translations of Beowulf,
  but this is the first translation that truly captured the feeling of those Old English
  words. I won't go into the plot of the story, because I'll assume most of us have
  read the book before. All I need to say is that, if you haven't read this translation,
  it's worth reading. And, if you're like me, it will make you fall in love with Beowulf
  all over again.
