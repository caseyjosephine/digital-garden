The first lecture of my English 101 class was a life-changing experience for me. My professor started out by reading to us from the original Old English text of Beowulf. The round, warm, Germanic sounds of the language resonated throughout the hall, and although I couldn't understand the words, I felt something of the work that I'd never felt before.<br/><br/>I've read numerous translations of Beowulf, but this is the first translation that truly captured the feeling of those Old English words. I won't go into the plot of the story, because I'll assume most of us have read the book before. All I need to say is that, if you haven't read this translation, it's worth reading. And, if you're like me, it will make you fall in love with Beowulf all over again.
