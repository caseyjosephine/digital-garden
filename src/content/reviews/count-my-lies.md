My Review: '3.5 ⭐️ BOTM pick for March 2025<br/><br/>Count My Lies was a fun thriller,
  with somewhat of a slow start. I needed to get more than halfway through for it
  to pick up, but once it got going it didn''t stop.<br/><br/>Entertaining. It isn''t
  particularly literary, nor does it purport to be. I could see this being adapted
  into a miniseries, and I would watch it. '
