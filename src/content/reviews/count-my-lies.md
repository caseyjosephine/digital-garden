3.5 ⭐️ BOTM pick for March 2025<br/><br/>Count My Lies was a fun thriller, with somewhat of a slow start. I needed to get more than halfway through for it to pick up, but once it got going it didn't stop.<br/><br/>Entertaining. It isn't particularly literary, nor does it purport to be. I could see this being adapted into a miniseries, and I would watch it.
