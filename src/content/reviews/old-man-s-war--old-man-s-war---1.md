John Scalzi is one of few writers with the ability to craft novels far more interesting than the back of the book synopsis would suggest. This is kind of a blessing and a curse. After finishing Lock In, which I liked much more than expected, I knew I want to read more by Scalzi. I also heard great things about Old Man's War, but I kept putting it off. I mean, who wants to read a book about old people at war?<br/><br/>Turns out I do. I really do. This was the old people at war book I never knew was missing from my life.<br/><br/>I'm much too verbose to write my own back of the book synopsis, and I also have an annoying penchant for just writing about myself and how clever I am when I try to summarize. So I won't try to write a better summary. I will say that this Scalzi's world-building is impressive, and he's quickly becoming my go-to recommendation for fantasy fans who want to dabble in science fiction.
