My Review: As an avid historical fiction fan, I picked this book up hoping to learn
  a few things about renaissance Florence. Instead, I got a chick lit story set in
  an exotic locale. <br/><br/>The book wasn't exactly a let-down, but it was finished
  and quickly forgotten about. While I wouldn't urge you to stay away from it, any
  one looking for a serious work of historical fiction will be sorely disappointed.
