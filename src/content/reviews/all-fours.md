My Review: This book is insufferable.<br/><br/>All Fours is competently written but
  lacks substance. Its entire schtick is that it's <i>edgy</i>. I probably would have
  pretended to like it when I was 25 and trying too hard.<br/><br/>Sometimes conventional
  and ordinary people cultivate friendships with quirky, artsy people to make themselves
  feel interesting. All Fours is the book version of that, an ogling caricature of
  a manic-pixie dream friend that exists to be viewed (and lightly judged) from the
  perspective of someone who is deeply boring.   <br/><br/>All Fours is ultimately
  a book about a privileged middle-aged white woman who says outrageous things and
  who sees working class people as less-than (when she deigns to see them at all).
  If I wanted that kind of story, I'd be better served by watching Real Housewives
  on Bravo. At least those shows are edited to be entertaining.
