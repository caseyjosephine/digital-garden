My Review: 'This could have been more interesting than it was. If you''re expecting
  a story about what it feels like to deal with madness, or how one copes with that,  you''ll
  have to go elsewhere. This book explores madness in a surface manner: it talks about
  the trappings of madness, and details some vignettes about life in a mental institute.
  Don''t expect anything more than that.'

This could have been more interesting than it was. If you're expecting a story about what it feels like to deal with madness, or how one copes with that,  you'll have to go elsewhere. This book explores madness in a surface manner: it talks about the trappings of madness, and details some vignettes about life in a mental institute. Don't expect anything more than that.
