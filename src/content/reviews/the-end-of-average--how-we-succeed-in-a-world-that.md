My Review: 'This book is mostly an argument of two related points. The first is that
  there''s no such thing as an average person, although many of the systems around
  us assume that there is. Indeed, the average is just a mathematical abstraction,
  but the cumulation of many average data points, as well as the subsequent expectation
  value of a human, is dramatically flawed. <br/><br/>The second point is that, by
  designing for the average, we design for no one. The book does mention a number
  of design points (pilot cockpits are throughly discussed, and surprisingly fascinating),
  but the scope is broader than design. The major argument is that you''re not doing
  anyone any favors by reducing them to the average, but that this is done all the
  time by schools and businesses. Truth.<br/><br/>I let the book wanting more: it''s
  short, and while it''s well written it didn''t exactly go into much depth. I''m
  definitely interested in reading another book on the topic, but next time I think
  I''ll go for something much more technical.'
