My Review: As writers go, I tend to be fairly lazy. On an intellectual level, I'm
  fully aware that writing mostly involves sitting down and actually writing. I get
  that the best way to work through writer's block is to just write anyway, and I
  also get that none of my pieces are going to come bursting like Athena from the
  head of Zeus, divine and fully formed. Most of the time, I manage to break through
  the lazy and actually get stuff done. Still, I'm constantly searching for that one
  weird trick that will minimize my efforts while simultaneously providing me with
  David Foster Wallace level output and Dan Brown level money.<br/><br/>Naturally,
  I began my love affair with books about writing back in high school, when my oeuvre
  mostly consisted of Alanis Morissette level poetry. Reading books about writing,
  and writers, makes me feel particularly productive without actually producing anything.
  I like to remind myself that Stephen King once said "If you don’t have the time
  to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that." (Note,
  Stephen King also wrote a book about writing, which I've read and reread in myriad
  moments of weakness and insecurity, then cursed at when I realized I once again
  had to get back to writing). Plus, it's nice to remember that Hemingway was often
  miserable and Fitzgerald was an alcoholic with a crazy wife. I'm an envious person,
  and I find schadenfreude restorative. <br/><br/>And yes, I fully understand that
  all those sections on plot and character development and living a writerly life
  are not particularly relevant when you mainly write academic nonfiction. I'm an
  intelligent person, and I've worked with some very smart graduate advisors who have
  made similar points before exasperatedly encouraging me to get back down to the
  lab and keep going. But still, I found Bird by Bird to be a useful meditation on
  writing. If only Anne Lamott had shared her real secrets, instead of adding another
  voice to the choir of people imploring me to just get back to work already.
