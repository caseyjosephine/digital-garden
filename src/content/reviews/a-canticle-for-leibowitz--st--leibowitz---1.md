My Review: 'Freaking awesome!<br/><br/>This is the kind of book I imagined I would
  be getting when I read [b:Foundation|29579|Foundation (Foundation, #1)|Isaac Asimov|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1320416085s/29579.jpg|1783981].
  I had heard a ton of great things about Foundation, and expected a thought-provoking
  book about a fallen civilization. Unfortunately, Foundation was poorly written,
  with wooden dialogue and a contrived plot.<br/><br/>Canticle, on the other hand,
  is well written, and subtle. It doesn''t offer easy answers, and instead brings
  up difficult questions about accessibility of knowledge and the cyclical nature
  of history. Definitely worth a read, particularly for anyone with an interest in
  Catholicism.'
