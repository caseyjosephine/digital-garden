Freaking awesome!<br/><br/>This is the kind of book I imagined I would be getting when I read [b:Foundation|29579|Foundation (Foundation, #1)|Isaac Asimov|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1320416085s/29579.jpg|1783981]. I had heard a ton of great things about Foundation, and expected a thought-provoking book about a fallen civilization. Unfortunately, Foundation was poorly written, with wooden dialogue and a contrived plot.<br/><br/>Canticle, on the other hand, is well written, and subtle. It doesn't offer easy answers, and instead brings up difficult questions about accessibility of knowledge and the cyclical nature of history. Definitely worth a read, particularly for anyone with an interest in Catholicism.
