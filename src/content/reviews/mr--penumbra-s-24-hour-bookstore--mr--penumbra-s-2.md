A fun little book, which contains a ton of stuff that I like. San Francisco. Bookstores. Typography. Data visualization. In the beginning, it promises a lot, but doesn't live up to that. Still, it's worth reading.<br/><br/>The thing that kind of annoyed me about the books it that it reads a bit like a love letter to Google. I had to check Robin Sloan's author profile, to see if he works there. He doesn't. However, this book could be read as a super creative Google job application. Stranger things have happened.
