My Review: A fun little book, which contains a ton of stuff that I like. San Francisco.
  Bookstores. Typography. Data visualization. In the beginning, it promises a lot,
  but doesn't live up to that. Still, it's worth reading.<br/><br/>The thing that
  kind of annoyed me about the books it that it reads a bit like a love letter to
  Google. I had to check Robin Sloan's author profile, to see if he works there. He
  doesn't. However, this book could be read as a super creative Google job application.
  Stranger things have happened.
