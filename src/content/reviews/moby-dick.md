My Review: 'When I was in third grade, I was supposed to go on a whale-watching field
  trip with my entire class. We had recently completed a cetology unit, in which we
  learned some things that Herman Melville didn''t know about whales, like that they
  aren''t actually fish. The whale-watching field trip turned out to be a disaster.<br/><br/>See,
  we needed to drive down with our parents and meet up at some pier somewhere in L.A.
  county (at this point in my childhood, my knowledge of southland freeways was a
  little nebulous, but if I recall correctly, I think this all happened in Santa Monica).
  My parents wanted to meet up with the parents of this kid who used to be my friend
  but I guess he and I had some sort of falling out, because at this point we <i>were
  not</i> friends. Anyway, the parents spent way too long lingering over their lunch,
  which I do recall being excellent (the restaurant had both shark and swordfish specials,
  and I got the shark, which was not shark fin by the way, don''t be alarmed). As
  you may imagine, fine dining didn''t necessarily mesh well the field trip schedule,
  and you may have already guessed the outcome.<br/><br/>We missed the boat.<br/><br/>My
  parents, who did somewhat understand the pedagogical value of being stuck on a boat
  with hundreds of screaming 8-year-olds, but who also had a strong desire to not
  be stuck on a boat with hundreds of screaming 8-year-olds, were visibly delighted.
  They gleefully bought us tickets for the next boat. I was forced to hang out with
  the other kid (who, remember, I was <i>no longer friends with</i>) and my brother,
  who was 4 at the time, and a few other stragglers.<br/><br/>We didn''t see any freaking
  whales (although there were some dolphins jumping around, so we did see some cetaceans,
  but that doesn''t count). I found out later that all the other kids saw whales.<br/><br/>Following
  this tragic event, my family forced me to go to the marina and hang out with them
  and the other kid and the other kid''s parents on their yacht, which at the time
  I didn''t think was cool <i>at all</i>. Naturally, I refused to hang out with anyone
  and instead went belowdecks. There, I put my worn-out Rolling Stones Greatest Hits
  cassette tape into my walkman, and listened to "Get Off of My Cloud" over and over
  as I wallowed in my self-pity and prepubescent despair.<br/><br/>Which is to say
  that, starting with childhood, I''ve had a complicated relationship with whales.
  This complicated relationship continues with Moby Dick.<br/><br/>Here''s the thing:
  everything you''ve heard about Moby Dick is true. It''s as poetic as it is long-winded,
  as hilarious as it is a serious meditation on desire and madness, as riveting as
  it is mind-numbingly boring. I''m having trouble coming up with a coherent explanation
  for how I feel about Moby Dick, because I feel a lot of things. It''s not often
  that I want to highlight every passage and throw my kindle across the El at the
  same time. I''m glad I read this, and I''m also glad it''s over. I''m going to go
  read something not about whales now. '
