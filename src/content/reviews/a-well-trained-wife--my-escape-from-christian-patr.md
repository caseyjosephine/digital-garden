Wow. Tia's story had me tearing up at the brutality of biblical patriarchy, and inspired by her strength. This is a timely cautionary tale of the theocracy that our elected officials are currently putting into place. It's not the pastoral idyll the trad wife influencers are selling. Patriarchy, by definition, does not serve women.<br/><br/>I'm sure a ton of people will balk and say what Tia experienced wasn't "true" Christianity, and that "real" Christians don't believe in the brutality she suffered. I'm happy not to be a Christian, which means I don't have to adjudicate or make any apologies for any of that particular mythology's various sects. A life free from religion is pretty great. I hope it remains legal.
