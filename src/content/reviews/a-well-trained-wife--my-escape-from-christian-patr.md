My Review: Wow. Tia's story had me tearing up at the brutality of biblical patriarchy,
  and inspired by her strength. This is a timely cautionary tale of the theocracy
  that our elected officials are currently putting into place. It's not the pastoral
  idyll the trad wife influencers are selling. Patriarchy, by definition, does not
  serve women.<br/><br/>I'm sure a ton of people will balk and say what Tia experienced
  wasn't "true" Christianity, and that "real" Christians don't believe in the brutality
  she suffered. I'm happy not to be a Christian, which means I don't have to adjudicate
  or make any apologies for any of that particular mythology's various sects. A life
  free from religion is pretty great. I hope it remains legal.
