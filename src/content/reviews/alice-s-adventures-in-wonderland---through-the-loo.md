Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass is a completely amazing, as much as it is ridiculously nonsensical. One of the things missing from the current generation is a sense of imagination: even kids movies involving fish or cars that can talk seem a bit dull and remarkably adult. The same is not true for Alice. Lewis Carroll weaves fabulously wordplay into a hugely imaginative plot that you will have to read to understand.
