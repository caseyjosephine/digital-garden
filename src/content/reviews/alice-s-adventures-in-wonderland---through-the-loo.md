My Review: 'Alice''s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass is a completely
  amazing, as much as it is ridiculously nonsensical. One of the things missing from
  the current generation is a sense of imagination: even kids movies involving fish
  or cars that can talk seem a bit dull and remarkably adult. The same is not true
  for Alice. Lewis Carroll weaves fabulously wordplay into a hugely imaginative plot
  that you will have to read to understand. '
