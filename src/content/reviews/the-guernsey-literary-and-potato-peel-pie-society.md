My Review: 'I can''t think of a great word to describe this book, although "charming,"
  "delightful" and "lovely" all come to mind. Perhaps a better endorsement is the
  fact that I was reminded of Nancy Mitford''s [b:The Pursuit of Love|835458|The Pursuit
  of Love|Nancy Mitford|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1178768641s/835458.jpg|821072],
  which is about as heartwarming as The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.
  An added bonus: both are also quick reads.<br/><br/>This book is about the aftermath
  of the German occupation of Guernsey, which I found quite interesting because I
  didn''t realize that the German''s had occupied Guernsey. Actually, I didn''t know
  much of anything about Guernsey at all. There are some tough moments in the book,
  but overall it''s pretty lighthearted. It''s a perfect summer read: a fast reader
  could finish it in one day at the beach.'
