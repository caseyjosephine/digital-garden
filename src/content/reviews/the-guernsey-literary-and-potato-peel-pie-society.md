I can't think of a great word to describe this book, although "charming," "delightful" and "lovely" all come to mind. Perhaps a better endorsement is the fact that I was reminded of Nancy Mitford's [b:The Pursuit of Love|835458|The Pursuit of Love|Nancy Mitford|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1178768641s/835458.jpg|821072], which is about as heartwarming as The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. An added bonus: both are also quick reads.<br/><br/>This book is about the aftermath of the German occupation of Guernsey, which I found quite interesting because I didn't realize that the German's had occupied Guernsey. Actually, I didn't know much of anything about Guernsey at all. There are some tough moments in the book, but overall it's pretty lighthearted. It's a perfect summer read: a fast reader could finish it in one day at the beach.
