My Review: 'I could easily make some comment about how I''m totally not a narcissist,
  then prattle off a bunch of personal anecdotes, then add a one-sentence platitude
  about how people should definitely read this book. But that would be trite, and
  my sense of grandiosity goes far beyond the exoteric.<br/><br/>In the tradition
  of Eula Biss''s On Immunity, Kristin Dombek proffers a lyrical examination of the
  etiology of narcissism. Throughout the essay, she remains present, yet detached,
  scientific, skeptical. The result is a philosophical work that challenges the readers
  to think for themselves: I found myself repeatedly stopping to work my way through
  the implications of Dombek''s ideas. To that end, I''ve come up with my own understanding
  of Dombek''s book, which was likely the point, but does not necessarily reflect
  the views of Dombek herself. Namely, embroiling ourselves in self-aggrandizing omphaloskepsis
  while deriding the narcissism of others is the new solipsism. Which is also profoundly
  human.  <br/><br/>Contemporary culture, particularly as it exists in hip urban locales
  including, but not limited to, Andersonville and Wicker Park in Chicago, Brooklyn,
  San Francisco''s Mission District, Portland, etc., values authenticity above all
  else. The operational definition of such authenticity varies, but prototypical exemplars
  are attending an intimate concert at a small bar years before the band is signed
  to a major label, crafting cocktails using classic techniques and the highest quality
  ingredients (usually featuring egg whites), not watching television, denouncing
  capitalism ("I don''t mean to seem like I care about material things like a social
  status") while revering the products of capitalism qua products ("I just want four
  walls and Adobe slabs for my girls"), and venerating facial hair. To be real, one
  must create in oneself a museum, carefully curating an ever-changing collection
  of erudite musings and cultural artifacts and displaying those that present a cohesive
  retrospective of the type of person one wants to be today. All other experiences
  are carefully archived, hidden until they become relevant enough for one to triumphantly
  declare "I saw the potential in this from the beginning. I knew it all along."<br/><br/>In
  this milieu, the worst thing one can be in inauthentic, basic, fake. The essence
  of narcissism for the non-narcissists (and none of us are narcissists, just like
  we''re all great drivers with perfect political opinions) is in diagnosing a lack
  of self, an empty shell that exists for the pleasure of our own derision. We, the
  real people, could never be like them, the shells. We are better. They are not worthy.<br/><br/>My
  meditation practice seems to conspire with the universe to make me a better person,
  despite my natural predilections toward being sardonically judgmental. The thing
  is, compassion is the hardest choice. It''s not easy for me to wish joy and happiness
  towards douche bags, or people who disagree with me politically, or people who don''t
  like Joy Division. Diagnosing people I dislike with a personality disorder so that
  I feel justified in hating them is easier than recognizing that we are all cosmic
  beings worthy of love and happiness. Within this philosophical paradigm, calling
  someone else narcissistic is in itself an act of narcissism.<br/><br/>Anyway, this
  book has reminded me to actually delve into the experiential realities of others,
  rather than simply dismissing them. I also feel a strong desire to engage in some
  loving kindness meditation dedicated towards everyone I know. You''re welcome, assholes.'
