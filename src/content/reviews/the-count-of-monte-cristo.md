My Review: Right now, I feel as if I can't get away from this book. It's everywhere.
  It's on every single Goodreads list I look at, and for some reason people have been
  talking about it. I think the universe is trying to tell me that I have to read
  it as soon as possible. Okay, universe. You win.
