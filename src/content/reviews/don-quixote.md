My Review: Can we construct our own reality? And, if we can, how should we? Does life
  present one transcendent truth, or is truth relative to each individual's perceptions?
  These are the questions central to Don Quixote, a secular bible of self-invention.<br/><br/>There
  are many things to say about this book, but I can't write them all down here. It
  wouldn't do much good, either, because everyone seems to get something different
  out of reading the Quixote. If you haven't read it, try it out and let it tell you
  what it wants to say to you. It is by no means a quick read, but it is worth it.<br/><br/>The
  Grossman edition is fantastic, although the introduction by Bloom is so curmudgeony
  that it should be skipped, or at least read with a large glass of wine.
