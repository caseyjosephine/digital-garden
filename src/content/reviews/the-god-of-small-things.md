My Review: 'I finished this book over a week ago but couldn''t figure out how to write
  a review of it. I decided to wait: after all, the book was absolutely extraordinary,
  so it deserves a good review. A week past, and I began to realize that I still hadn''t
  come up with any review fodder, and it started to weigh down on me. After ten days,
  I decided to just start writing and see what happened. Mea culpa.<br/><br/>It''s
  hard to write about The God of Small Things because it''s non-linear. What''s more,
  the most remarkable thing about it is it''s literary style, which manages to be
  completely different from anything else I''ve ever read (and I''ve read quite a
  bit). The setting is the southernmost tip of India, and Roy''s writing takes the
  reader there completely. It''s just so evocative: of a time, of a place, of a particular
  feeling. The narrative centers around a family, which has been broken apart by a
  terrible tragedy (I can''t tell you what this is, that''s part of the fun). Ostensibly,
  the main character is Rahel, one of a set of two-egg twins who returns to her childhood
  home and re-experiences her past in a way that''s so psychologically real that I''m
  tempted to call it Proustian. Don''t be fooled, though: the real protagonist is
  the writing itself.<br/><br/>I can''t say anymore. Just read it, you won''t be disappointed.'
