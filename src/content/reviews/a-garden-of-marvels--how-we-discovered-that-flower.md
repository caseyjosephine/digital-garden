Ruth Kassinger's lovely book about the plants in our lives starts with a murder: she describes, in heartbreaking detail, the death of a kumquat tree that she had lovingly cared for. From the beginning, I knew I had found a kindred spirit in Kassinger. I love plants: one of my favorite activities is photographing flowers at the botanic gardens, and I dream about someday having a garden full of food that I can take from the ground to my dinner table. Unfortunately, I'm most adept at killing plants, partly because I'm absent-minded, partly because I just have no idea what I'm doing. Actually, if you will excuse me for a moment, I have to tend to my aloe, it's not doing so well.<br/><br/>A Garden of Marvels is a meandering book that's one part science history, one part memoir, one part [a:Mary Roach|7956|Mary Roach|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1363641585p2/7956.jpg]esque contemporary science writing. The structure is part of its charm, although I did find that it was best read in small doses. In the end, I found myself deeply invested in the fate of Kassinger's hybrid citrus tree. <br/><br/>This was a perfect read for spring, and I recommend it to anyone interested in plants!
