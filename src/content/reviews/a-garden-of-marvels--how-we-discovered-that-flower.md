My Review: 'Ruth Kassinger''s lovely book about the plants in our lives starts with
  a murder: she describes, in heartbreaking detail, the death of a kumquat tree that
  she had lovingly cared for. From the beginning, I knew I had found a kindred spirit
  in Kassinger. I love plants: one of my favorite activities is photographing flowers
  at the botanic gardens, and I dream about someday having a garden full of food that
  I can take from the ground to my dinner table. Unfortunately, I''m most adept at
  killing plants, partly because I''m absent-minded, partly because I just have no
  idea what I''m doing. Actually, if you will excuse me for a moment, I have to tend
  to my aloe, it''s not doing so well.<br/><br/>A Garden of Marvels is a meandering
  book that''s one part science history, one part memoir, one part [a:Mary Roach|7956|Mary
  Roach|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1363641585p2/7956.jpg]esque
  contemporary science writing. The structure is part of its charm, although I did
  find that it was best read in small doses. In the end, I found myself deeply invested
  in the fate of Kassinger''s hybrid citrus tree. <br/><br/>This was a perfect read
  for spring, and I recommend it to anyone interested in plants!'
