My Review: This book seemed to come to me when I was at the right place at the right
  time. I was in my first year at college, and the prevalence of rape on campus was
  absolutely terrifying. After hearing about another date-rape situation in the dorms,
  I decided to pick up Lucky.<br/><br/>Lucky details something that most of us have
  heard of, worried about, and never want to go though. Although the subject material
  is dark, I did enjoy reading it. The book gives a detailed view into what it's like
  to survive rape, and with this information I feel that we can get one step closer
  to stopping it.
