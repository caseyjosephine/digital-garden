This book seemed to come to me when I was at the right place at the right time. I was in my first year at college, and the prevalence of rape on campus was absolutely terrifying. After hearing about another date-rape situation in the dorms, I decided to pick up Lucky.<br/><br/>Lucky details something that most of us have heard of, worried about, and never want to go though. Although the subject material is dark, I did enjoy reading it. The book gives a detailed view into what it's like to survive rape, and with this information I feel that we can get one step closer to stopping it.
