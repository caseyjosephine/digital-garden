My Review: Blink is an interesting and thought-provoking book. It examines  the ways
  in which we make decisions quickly, often without even knowing that we are making
  them. My favorite section of the book was the chapter which recounts a recent war
  game. In this game, the computer aided US team could not work as well as a former
  general who was able to make decisions quickly and correctly. If stories like this
  appeal to you, the book is definitely worth reading. <br/><br/>That said, Blink
  has a number of problems. While the stories provided are interesting, Gladwell doesn't
  really build them into a well formed point. As others have said, the stories outweigh
  the conclusions. Another problem is that the book purports to be scientific, while
  is it really a series of loosely related observations. It's a neat book, but those
  looking for a scientific treatment of quick-thinking should definitely turn elsewhere.
