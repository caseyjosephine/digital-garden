So I'm reading [b:Neverwhere|14497|Neverwhere|Neil Gaiman|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1348747943s/14497.jpg|16534], which involves an underground version of London, and I remembered that, in middle school, I had read some terrible-cum-awesome young adult novel about a princess that lives underground who falls through a wishing well and ends up above ground. And, of course, she has to go to high school, and falls in love with some generic cool high school dude, and then she has to choose between true love or her home/destiny. You know, because that storyline is not at all contrived.<br/><br/>Anyway, I found the title by searching for "fantasy novel princess from underground world comes to high school." Thanks, Google.
