My Review: Unicorns. Consciousness. Paperclips.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to describe
  Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, except to say that it's a rare
  cerebral page-turner. Murakami is incomparable, and this is certainly the mostly
  tightly structured and creative of his books that I have read so far.
