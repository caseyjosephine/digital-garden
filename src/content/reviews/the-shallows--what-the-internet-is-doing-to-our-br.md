My Review: 'The internet is a jumble of information: as I type this, I have two different
  email inboxes open in different tabs, another tab open to a blog post, instant messaging
  windows chiming, and text-messages being sent to my computer through Apple''s iMessages
  systems (I forgot it was called iMessages, so I also had to open google and look
  that up). In short, my computer screen effectively works as a purveyor of distraction;
  in The Shallows, Nicolas Carr argues that the internet impacts my brain outside
  the pleasantly-blunted edges of my MacBook Pro (and my iPhone. And iPad. And, come
  to think of it, my Apple TV).<br/><br/>In making his argument, Carr first examines
  the history of information technology, starting with scrolls, wax-tablets, and my
  beloved codex. He shows that the type of "deep-reading" afforded by books is an
  anomaly in our history, although one with a myriad of benefits. This history covers
  everything from Guttenberg to artificial intelligence to Google, and is the best
  part of the book.<br/><br/>Carr also examines the scientific literature on multi-tasking
  (something people simply cannot do well), memory, and cognitive load. He argues
  that the internet puts more demands on executive function, leading to poorer storage
  and retrieval of information. This is supposed to affect our brains through neuroplasticity
  (changes in brain structure due to particular inputs), although he doesn''t cite
  much evidence specific to internet use and reading. Carr''s understanding of the
  scientific literature is fairly shallow, but not necessarily incorrect. If I were
  to grade his work in an introductory course on cognitive psychology, I''d have to
  mark him down for lack of precision.<br/><br/>One minor pet-peeve: Carr uses the
  term "the Net" to refer to the internet, which feels as out-of-touch as saying "the
  world wide web" or "the information superhighway." I''m guessing this was an editing
  decision, but it still bothers me.'
