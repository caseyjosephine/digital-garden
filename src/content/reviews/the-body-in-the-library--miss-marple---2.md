My Review: 'True story: I picked this up because it was in the bargain bin, and I
  had been meaning to read some Agatha Christie, and I worked in a library at the
  time. I started working at the library in 2006 and left that position in 2009, so
  that gives you some idea of how long this has been sitting on my bookshelf, unread.
  <br/><br/>Agatha Christie sure makes murder seem quite civilized, which probably
  goes a long way in explaining her appeal. Unfortunately, Miss Marple’s detective
  work feels a bit too much like a parlor trick. Miss Marple doesn’t do much real
  investigation, but simply stands back, observes, and connects random aspects of
  the scene to people in her small village. Of course, she solves the crime anyway.
  It’s cute, but the whole thing smacks of disingenuousness to me.<br/><br/>Part of
  this is that, admittedly, I’m not big on cozy mystery novels. I prefer my detectives
  to have a difficult past and an uncertain future.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most bizarre
  aspect of this novel is the subplot in which we’re supposed to feel worse for the
  rich dude in whose library the body was found than the actual murder victim. The
  idea being that the body might tarnish his reputation. Um, okay?<br/><br/>Still,
  this was a fun little read, and I’m starting to understand why Christie is such
  a best seller. She’s somewhat like the Bud Light of novelists: won’t fill you up,
  but never let you down. But, you know, more civilized.'
