My Review: 'I waffled between giving this a two or three star review, and, as much
  as I’d like to give it three stars, I just can’t do it. Still Alice sounds like
  an excellent book: the story of a Harvard Professor Cognitive Psychology who gets
  diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers. Author Lisa Genova, also a cognitive psychologist,
  did a considerable amount of research for the book, and I looked forward to reading
  a depiction of the experiential reality of Alzheimers from someone uniquely qualified
  to fictionalize it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Genova’s academic expertise far outpaces
  her writing ability, which significantly reduced the impact of her overall message.
  Indeed, it read more like a subpar young adult novel than serious fiction for adults,
  which is a shame. I figured this out early on: in one of the first chapters, Genova
  describes Alice and her husband’s physical appearance by having them look at themselves
  in the mirror (note to aspiring writers: if you find it necessary to make sure the
  reader knows what your characters look like, emulate Tolstoy, rather than Stephenie
  Meyer. I can still picture Natasha, slight and ebullient, sitting restlessly on
  the couch of her drawing room, just as I can easily visualize the Little Princess,
  with her peach fuzz mustache. Yet I have no recollection of what Alice is supposed
  to look like, even though I just read the description two days ago, because Genova
  never gave me a reason to care.). The writing doesn’t get any better from there,
  with a random Mary Sue-ish episode in which Alice ends up at the same restaurant
  as Jennifer Aniston, and obnoxious PSAs about support for people with Alzheimers
  thrown in, seemingly independent of the plot.<br/><br/>Actually, the whole thing
  read like a very special episode of a lowest-common-demoniator sitcom. Exhibit A:<br/><br/><img
  src="http://i.imgur.com/lNEwLnP.gif" title="source: imgur.com" /><br/><br/>Definitely
  a fascinating subject, though. I’d like to see it explored in the future, in the
  hands of a more capable writer.'
