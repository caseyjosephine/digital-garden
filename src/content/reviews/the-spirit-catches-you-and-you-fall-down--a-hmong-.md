My Review: 'I feel incredibly conflicted about this book. It''s two books, really,
  one of which is quite good, one of which isn''t. The good book is the one that details
  the story of the Hmong people. Before reading this, I was unaware of their role
  in the Vietnam War, as well as the fact that there are a sizable number of Hmong
  refugees in my home state of California. It was particularly interesting to learn
  about their customs. More than once in the book, Fadiman talks about sacrificing
  a pig as if that''s some sort of bat-shit crazy thing to do, but I think we''d be
  much better off if everyone treated the source of their food with that much personal
  reverence. <br/><br/>Two books: one about the Hmong, which was generally excellent,
  and another about a little Hmong girl with epilepsy, which made me want to throw
  the book against the wall. Repeatedly.<br/><br/>So the thing that really bothers
  me about this book is that Fadiman seems to take it for granted that doctors know
  best. Fadiman talks about how brilliant Lia''s pediatricians were (if I were to
  be objective here, based on the interviews with said pediatricians, I say they come
  off as middling and arrogant, but whatever). She writes about a doctor who respects
  his patients'' right to have a say in their treatment as if he''s an idiot, saying
  "Roger Fife happened to espouse a philosophy that carried more weight with the Hmong
  than any degree of knowledge, intelligence, or technical skill." Her bias is obvious,
  but she still claims that her books is objective.<br/><br/>Alright, so here''s the
  thing: it would be one thing if doctors really were these magical, ethereal beings
  who knew exactly the right path to take to treat all illnesses. But, as a scientist
  myself, I can safely say that even the most intelligent people don''t know shit
  about anything, especially not about the brain. Example: one particularly famous
  patient, H.M., had intractable epilepsy that was treated by the surgical removal
  of most of his hippocampus. And it totally worked: no more epilepsy! Unfortunately,
  the hippocampus is kind of important: to simplify, it is in charge of consolidating
  short-term memory into long-term memory. So H.M. ended up having anterograde amnesia,
  which meant that he was unable to form any new long-term memories. This was a boon
  for science (we researched the hell out of that guy), but not so much for H.M.<br/><br/>Now,
  I''m not saying that doctors are idiots or anything, nor am I saying that Western
  Medicine isn''t a good thing. But it''s one thing to consult with a doctor, and
  another to blindly follow his or her advice, especially given the state of health
  care in the U.S. and the influence of pharmaceutical companies (did you see the
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/opinion/dont-give-more-patients-statins.html?hp&rref=opinion&_r=0">new
  recommendations for statins yet?</a> Um, yeah). Yet, this is exactly what Fadiman
  seems to think that the Lee family should have done: there''s evidence of this on
  page after page. About 70 pages in, that really began to grate on me. <br/><br/>The
  issue for Lia Lee wasn''t that her parents wanted to treat her one way, and the
  doctors wanted to treat her another way. No no. The issue was that her parents were
  refugees who were not literate, did not speak English, were not offered translators,
  and could not truly consent to anything. Yet the doctors were completely unwilling
  to take the time to make sure her parents understood her course of treatment, or
  take her culture into account at all. At one point, one of the doctors treating
  Lia mistakes her for a boy, <i>and Fadiman uses this as evidence of how well she
  had been treated(?!?!?!?).</i> So this book, the second book, really is less about
  cultural clash, and more about the failings of a medical system that has never worked
  well, and that works particularly poorly for those who don''t have the ability to
  advocate for themselves.'

I feel incredibly conflicted about this book. It's two books, really, one of which is quite good, one of which isn't. The good book is the one that details the story of the Hmong people.
