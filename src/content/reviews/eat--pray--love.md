My Review: 'I wanted to like this. Really. I didn''t expect it to be particularly
  good, but I love yoga almost as much as I love travelling, and I mostly travel so
  that I eat as many foreign delicacies as possible, so it sounded up my alley.<br/><br/>People
  have complained that Gilbert is spoiled and self-centered, which is certainly true.
  This isn''t a deal breaker for me, though. After all, Proust wrote thousands of
  semi-autobiographical pages whilst hanging out in his bedroom, and I''m happy enough
  to read that. I don''t expect writers to be people I''d like to be friends with:
  most of the time, the crazy and unstable ones are the most interesting.<br/><br/>My
  issue with Gilbert is that she''s not particularly insightful. Reading Eat, Pray,
  Love was an experience akin to eavesdropping on someone else''s conversation while
  riding the subway: "Oh my God, and like, in Italy, the food was sooooooo good. I
  had, like, such good pizza. And yoga, is like, so enlightening, and like so spiritual.
  And I totally always knew I''d go back to Indonesia. It was so life-changing and
  stuff."'
