I wanted to like this. Really. I didn't expect it to be particularly good, but I love yoga almost as much as I love travelling, and I mostly travel so that I eat as many foreign delicacies as possible, so it sounded up my alley.<br/><br/>People have complained that Gilbert is spoiled and self-centered, which is certainly true. This isn't a deal breaker for me, though. After all, Proust wrote thousands of semi-autobiographical pages whilst hanging out in his bedroom, and I'm happy enough to read that. I don't expect writers to be people I'd like to be friends with: most of the time, the crazy and unstable ones are the most interesting.<br/><br/>My issue with Gilbert is that she's not particularly insightful. Reading Eat, Pray, Love was an experience akin to eavesdropping on someone else's conversation while riding the subway: "Oh my God, and like, in Italy, the food was sooooooo good. I had, like, such good pizza. And yoga, is like, so enlightening, and like so spiritual. And I totally always knew I'd go back to Indonesia. It was so life-changing and stuff."
