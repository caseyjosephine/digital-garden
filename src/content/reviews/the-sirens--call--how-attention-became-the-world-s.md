My Review: 'I appreciate an author that leans into irony. Chris Hayes is a TV newscaster,
  who earns a living by getting people to pay attention to him and his network (MSNBC).
  <br/><br/>The Sirens'' Call is a well-researched micro-history of Attention, with
  the perfect amount of self-inserts from Hayes. This could so easily have gone into
  the typical "screen time these days, am I right?" line of journalism, but it chose
  a far more interesting trajectory. I tore through each chapter, because they each
  functioned as self-contained essays about the impacts of the attention economy.
  <br/><br/>This book has a lot going on, but I''d say the main topic is the economics
  of attention, specifically within a system that has an unlimited amount of information.
  Fascinating, highly recommended. '
