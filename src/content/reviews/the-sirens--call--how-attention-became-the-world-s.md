I appreciate an author that leans into irony. Chris Hayes is a TV newscaster, who earns a living by getting people to pay attention to him and his network (MSNBC). <br/><br/>The Sirens' Call is a well-researched micro-history of Attention, with the perfect amount of self-inserts from Hayes. This could so easily have gone into the typical "screen time these days, am I right?" line of journalism, but it chose a far more interesting trajectory. I tore through each chapter, because they each functioned as self-contained essays about the impacts of the attention economy. <br/><br/>This book has a lot going on, but I'd say the main topic is the economics of attention, specifically within a system that has an unlimited amount of information. Fascinating, highly recommended.
