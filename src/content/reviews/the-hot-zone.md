My Review: I read this mostly because I wasn't feeling well, and my less page-turny
  books weren't able to hold my attention. This may or may not have been a good idea,
  since the book details the effects of filoviruses. They are not pleasant. They're
  something you don't want to come down with, and (luckily) you probably won't.<br/><br/>Although
  this is non-fiction, it reads like a thriller. You will be biting your nails, hoping
  that people you've come to care about don't break with Ebola. It feels like brain
  candy, although it's more like those super sour candies that make your brain hurt
  afterword. Definitely worth a quick read.
