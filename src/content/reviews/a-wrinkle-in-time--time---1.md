My Review: When I picked this book up in third grade, I wasn't quite sure about it.
  It was a fantasy book, after all, and at that point in time I was much more interested
  in the baby-sitter's club. But this book pulled me in, and even though it was a
  bit of an ambitious read for an eight year old, I finished it rather quickly.<br/><br/>I've
  re-read this book quite often, even as an adult, and it impresses me every time.
  This book really piqued my interest in science as a child, but it goes far deeper
  than that. Although I'm not religious like L'Engle, the idea that love for family
  members and friends should be completely unconditional, and that it transcends all
  evil, is a value no one could argue with.
