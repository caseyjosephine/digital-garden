My Review: 'Well, if the Nazis won WWII, things would have gotten pretty terrible.
  Luckily, this didn’t happen, which makes reading about an alternate universe in
  which it did more intellectually interesting than actually terrifying. Philip K.
  Dick’s version of a Nazi victory is certainly compelling, and it even contains a
  book within a book, which depicts an alternate version of an allied victory. Meta!<br/><br/>My
  main problem with this book is the same problem I’ve had with other Philip K. Dick
  books: the concept is compelling, but the narrative feels disconnected and disjointed.
  I had little investment in the characters, and I spent a lot of the book wishing
  that Philip K. Dick would write in complete sentences. So, while I found the idea
  interesting, the writing style just isn’t for me.'
