My Review: 'Sometimes a certain book comes around at a particularly serendipitous
  time, and changes, inexorably, the way one thinks about the world. The House of
  Mirth was such a book for me, although I cannot articulate precisely why.<br/><br/>Miss
  Lily Bart flits about in a social world that is at once familiar and foreign. Born
  into New York''s upper class, she repudiates "dinginess" and contents herself with
  her own loveliness and aptitude for society. However, she has lost her fortune,
  lost her parents, and clings to the upper crust by her thin and manicured fingers.
  Wharton recounts her tragic fall from belle du jour to scorned demimondaine, with
  the harsh reality of the situation juxtaposed with effulgent prose.<br/><br/>What
  do two women in their twenties, one living in 19th century New York, one in 21st
  century Chicago, have in common? At first blush, not much: that luxurious world
  of servants, long voyages abroad, and societal scandal feels removed from modern
  workaday life. However, Lily''s world is not unlike our own, where the shrinking
  middle class means that life leaves us either disgustingly rich, or disgustingly
  poor. Lily had always been told that she needed a particular lifestyle, that she
  was born into it, that she could be nothing but rich. As I read her story, I couldn''t
  help thinking about friends of mine, still unemployed college graduates. They, too,
  had been told that they were destined for a good job and a nice home, just so long
  as they spent a few years getting a college degree. But that shimmery world of opportunity
  exists about as much for us as it did for Lily Bart, although I hope we''re a bit
  better equipped to deal with the letdown.<br/><br/>But as much as Lily''s world
  reminds me of ours, I must recognize that women living now are far better off than
  the "girls" moving through turn-of-the-century society. No one balks when women
  deign to support themselves with a job, even in retail. Friends do not propose that
  our troubles would be solved if we just married rich. And a woman who vows to no
  longer live beyond her means, who accepts honest work so that she can pay her debts,
  would not be considered an inspiration, as opposed to a cautionary tale. <br/><br/>The
  House of Mirth is worth reading, for the scandalous story, the sordid characters,
  the masterful writing. I can''t promise you''ll enjoy it as much as I did, but I
  bet the story will continue to resonate long after you read the last page.'
