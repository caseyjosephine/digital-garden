My Review: Here are some things I knew about the Romanovs before reading Nicholas
  and Alexandra:<br/><br/>-Their rule ended because of the Russian Revolution, which
  did not go particularly well for them (or for anyone, really).<br/><br/>-Alexis
  was a hemophiliac.<br/><br/>-Rasputin was somehow involved, and he was also a bearded
  super-creeper.<br/><br/>-The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qktFsWuHzxE">1997
  animated film</a> is, sadly, not an accurate portrayal of the fate of Anastasia
  Romanova.<br/><br/>Which is to say that I learned quite a lot from this book.<br/><br/>My
  history classes had an overly-simplistic narrative about European revolutions. The
  story always went that the monarchs were fools who cared more about jewelry than
  their own people, and deserved to be deposed. The people were always doing the right
  thing, and we didn't learn much about the bloody executions and power struggles
  that took place away from the royal palaces. The end result was always that revolution
  paved the way for democracy (yay, democracy!!! Democracy is always right all the
  time always!!!), or that revolutions temporarily created communist states (boo,
  communism, communists are always evil and starving and bad), but that eventually
  these communist states would realize that democracy is like totally the best thing
  EVAH, so no worries.<br/><br/>Nicholas and Alexandra, of course, provides a more
  nuanced story of the Russian Revolution. At the center stands Nicholas, a family
  man who cared deeply about Russia yet never questioned his hereditary right to autocracy.
  Next time him is Alexandra, a devout mother caring for a chronically-ill son. Alexandra
  seemed to have a fairly thorny personality, but Massie convincingly argues that
  Alexandra was also emotionally manipulated by Rasputin. Massie speculates that things
  would have turned out different for Russia if little Alexis hadn't been born with
  hemophilia. If Alexis were well, then Rasputin couldn't have come to power, Alexandra
  would not have been convinced by Rasputin to fight for complete autocracy, and Nicholas
  might have allowed Russia to become a constitutional monarchy. It's an interesting
  bit of speculative history, which I could easily see being true.<br/><br/>It's obvious
  that the imperial family had no business running Russia, which had more than its
  fair share of problems. However, it's also obvious that the Romanovs didn't deserve
  to be brutally executed. Nicholas and Alexandra presents a balanced portrait of
  the last Russian monarchs, and I recommend the book for anyone interested in Russia.
