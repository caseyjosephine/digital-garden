Harry Potter, in what is supposed to be his final year at Hogwarts, has only almost certain death to look forward to. The magical world has become unsafe, invaded by death eaters, the loyal servants of he-who-must-not-be-named. Somehow, 17 year old Harry and his friends, Hermione and Ron, must stop Voldemort from taking over their world.<br/><br/>To destroy Voldemort, Harry must first find and destroy the horcruxes, but he doesn't know where to start on this seemingly impossible task. Ron and Hermione follow him through difficult terrain, biding their time in secret until they can confront Voldemort at last.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling, the master story-teller of our time, weaves a narrative that is exciting and fast paced, making Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows impossible to put down. All those who have shared in Harry's previous triumphs and tribulations need to read this book, for the closure of seeing how the story will end, and who will survive...
