My Review: 'True story: I just finished reading The Shining and I''m completely freaked
  out right now. While writing this review, I''ve turned on The Daily Show (comedy)
  and started making bacon mac and cheese (comfort) in an attempt to return to the
  real world, where the only thing that scares me with relative frequency is the economy.
  I don''t know how well that will work, because I have an irrational desire to lock
  my bathroom door from the outside. If all else fails, at least there''s wine....unless
  (and it''s possible) Stephen King has also ruined that for me forever.<br/><br/>Deep
  breath. There are no creepy dead ghost zombie things in my bathroom. I am a scientist
  and I''m like 99.9% sure of that. If that degree of certainty is good enough for
  the journals <i>Science</i> and <i>Nature</i>, it''s good enough for me.<br/><br/>My
  history with The Shining began spring quarter, Freshman year of college. I was taking
  Intro to Film Studies, a course which required a weekly screening of a pedagogically
  relevant film. For horror, we watched The Shining. Now, Film Studies was in a large
  lecture hall, with a large movie screen and a state of the art sound system. I walked
  in expecting some campy old "scary" film. What I saw was Kurbick''s masterpiece
  in all it''s analog glory. Let me tell you, biking from Buchanan back to my dorm
  that night was pure torture. And when I arrived in the Francisco Torres lobby, this
  is what I saw:<br/><br/><a href="http://imgur.com/fsC8n6N"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fsC8n6N.gif"
  title="Hosted by imgur.com" /></a><br/><br/>I lived on the 7th floor. I took the
  stairs.<br/><br/>Anyway, I kind of ended up avoiding reading The Shining for a long
  time, for a couple of reasons. First of all, I couldn''t imagine that the book could
  be scarier than the movie (and it''s not, but it''s on par with the movie, which
  is pretty damn scary). More importantly, though, I knew that Stephen King hated
  the adaptation, which gave me pause. See, I thought The Shining (film) was brilliant,
  and I heard The Shining (book) had such contrivances as moving topiary. So, I figured
  that this was one of those times where a mediocre book somehow became one of the
  greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>I was wrong, both about the topiary (OMG please
  do not let me go near any topiary right now and also I am very, very happy that
  it is winter and all the plants are dead and I do not want them to come to life
  and try and kill me), and about the book. <br/><br/>Flash-forward to January 2014:
  I''m snowed in. A so-called "polar vortex" descends upon the Midwest, and for a
  few days it''s too dangerous to venture outside. My brilliant idea is to read The
  Shining, because that seems fitting. Way to make the feelings of cabin fever dissipate,
  Casey. Luckily, The Shining (novel), which really is fundamentally different from
  The Shining (film), is actually incredibly good, and I''m kicking myself for not
  getting to it sooner. And I''m sure I''ll stop being scared of it eventually.<br/><br/>Unrelated:
  I think I''ll be using the bathroom at the Starbucks down the street until further
  notice. You know, just in case.'
