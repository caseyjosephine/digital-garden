My Review: A Walk to Remember details the story of Jamie Sullivan, a preacher's daughter
  who seems to know everything, and Landon Carter, the boy who would never be tempted
  by Jamie in real life. The plot is predictable enough, even if you haven't seen
  the movie. I won't spoil the ending here, but it leaves quite a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>I
  wanted to like this book, since so many people I knew enjoyed it, but I ended up
  hating it. The material was far too idyllic in some parts, and overly sanguine in
  others. I could see how Nicholas Sparks fans could like it, but it didn't have enough
  heart or plot to keep me interested.
