My Review: I listened to this book via Audible; it was 43 hours long. About 13 hours
  in, I was surprised that I had already listened for so long. I consoled myself with
  the 30 hours I had left, since 13 hours wasn’t even half of what I had left. It
  would take me forever to finish this, right? By the time I had hit 22 hours, I felt
  taken by surprise. I was halfway done? Really? But still, I had so many more hours
  of listening. 22 hours is almost an entire day, and surely that would feel like
  forever. At 35 five hours, I started to feel concerned. I wasn’t ready for this
  to be over. I didn’t know if I could handle it.<br/><br/>About five hours from the
  end of the book, I started freaking out. Then, I started writing this review. I
  felt compelled to shout my love for the Kingkiller Chronicles from the rooftops,
  with an obsession I haven’t felt since I made Harry Potter fan sites on Angelfire
  so many years ago. I’ve fallen in love with Rothfuss’s entire world, so I consider
  myself intensely biased. I know the flaws are there, and I could tell you what they
  are, but the truth is that I don’t care. I’m enamored and I make no apologies.<br/><br/>Now
  I’m done, and I don’t know what to do with my life. I kind of feel like Kvothe,
  whenever Deena skips town. He just wanders around, looking for her, not finding
  her anywhere. And now, I’m just going to wander around bookstores, not seeing the
  third book and being sad. And I don’t even have a lute to keep me occupied.<br/><br/>Is
  it time for a re-read already?
