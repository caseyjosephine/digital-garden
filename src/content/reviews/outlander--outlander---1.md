My Review: 'I''m somewhat disturbed by the fact that Outlander has a higher average
  rating than Middlemarch, Ulysses, and Anna Karenina. This book is fun, as you might
  expect from a time-travel romance novel, but it''s not particularly good. Scratch
  that: it''s actually kind of bad.<br/><br/>Okay, you know those truth or dare games
  you played in middle/high school? You know how you totally wished that that one
  guy you knew would convince his awesome hot friend (you know, the one whose name
  you scribbled all over your notebooks, surrounded by hearts) to date you ON A DARE.
  And at first, it would totally not be all about feelings or anything, because it''s
  A DARE, so you could both be really blasé about the whole thing. But, eventually,
  you''d actually find out that you''re really in love with each other, and it wouldn''t
  feel like a dare anymore at all, and everything would work out perfectly, and you''d
  get to wear a really awesome dress to prom. Well, you know how this <i>actually</i>
  works out: eventually, you find out that your life is not like the 1999 film <a
  href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFwkhn35Szk">She''s All That</a> (related disappointing
  revelation: you find out that you''re just as attractive without your glasses as
  you are with them. Turns out, taking off your glasses DOES NOT automatically make
  you a super model, no matter what your favorite <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQWSsPvVUaY">Disney
  Channel Original Movie</a> has lead you to believe).<br/><br/>Anyway, Outlander
  is a lot like that. But with Highlanders.'
