Now this is the kind of J.K. Rowling book I'm used to!<br/><br/>Alright, so if you read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/413712461">my review of The Casual Vacancy</a>, you know I thought it was a hot mess. I felt as if Rowling had examined all her strengths as a writer (pacing, absorbing plots, realistic yet flawed characters), and then played to none of them. Maybe she put too much pressure on herself to do something brilliant, I don't know.

Meanwhile, I'll be sitting here anxiously awaiting the next Cormoran Strike book.
