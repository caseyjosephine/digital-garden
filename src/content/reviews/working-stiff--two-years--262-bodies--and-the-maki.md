My Review: 'I never considered myself to have a particular penchant for the macabre,
  but this is the second book I''ve read that mainly focused on dead bodies. The first
  one, [b:Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers|32145|Stiff  The Curious Lives
  of Human Cadavers|Mary Roach|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1347656489s/32145.jpg|1188203],
  was jovial in tone: author Mary Roach purposely dehumanized human cadavers, in order
  to explore the wacky thing they do after they''re dead (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098627/">related</a>).
  Judy Melinek takes the opposite route, and talks about the work she does to give
  dignity and closure to real people.<br/><br/>Melinek came to Forensic Pathology
  from what seems to me to be an unusual route. She initially trained as a surgeon,
  but found that the realities of a surgeon''s life prevented her from being able
  to really do her job (or live her life). She worked incredibly long shifts, and
  was expected to never take a sick day: indeed, she recounts performing an appendectomy
  with a higher fever than her patient. She eventually decided to give up surgery
  and begin training as a pathologist. In a morgue, there''s not real need to work
  30 hour shifts or spend countless nights in an on call room: the dead, apparently,
  can wait.<br/><br/><img src="http://www.caseyjosephine.com/images/gifs/scrubs_doug.gif"><br/><br/>(I''m
  including this GIF to lighten the mood, although it''s somewhat relevant, because
  I know I''m talking about dead bodies here)<br/><br/>Working Stiff recounts Melinek''s
  two year fellowship as a New York City medical examiner. Many of us have ideas of
  what it''s like to work as a medical examiner, because the medical examiner has
  become a token character on procedural dramas. Exhibit A:<br/><br/><img src="http://www.caseyjosephine.com/images/gifs/castle_lanie.gif"><br/><br/>In
  reality, most of the work centers on accidents and unexpected natural deaths, as
  opposed to homicides. Apparently, homicides are generally boring: they tend to show
  a lot of blunt trauma, and it''s pretty clear what happened. Unexpected deaths,
  on the other hand, are fundamentally more interesting. In these cases, it''s the
  medical examiner''s job to piece together what happened from the physical evidence,
  and use it to give the bereaved family some closure.<br/><br/>Probably the best
  section in the book is the chapter that focuses on the recovery and identification
  of the victims of 9/11. Melinek had only been working at her fellowship position
  for nine weeks on September 11, 2001. She recounts her work on identifying the victims
  in detail, and the scene she sets is fairly gruesome. In one case, the only thing
  to identify was a hand with an impeccable French manicure. This section had me crying,
  which is something that rarely happens.<br/><br/>I heard about this book from <a
  href="http://www.npr.org/2014/08/17/340083142/medical-examiner-staying-alive-is-mostly-common-sense">the
  author''s interview on NPR</a>. It''s a short snippet, but worth a listen: it prompted
  me to get the book immediately, and I couldn''t put it down until I finished. While
  the topic may be off-putting to some, I would highly recommend Working Stiff to
  anyone who might be interested, without reservations.'
