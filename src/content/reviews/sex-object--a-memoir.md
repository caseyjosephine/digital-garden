My Review: 'Here are some events, endured by yours truly, perpetrated by strangers:<br/><br/>-Guy
  trying to walk me home while aggressively flirting and asking for my contact information,
  culminating in me walking in the complete opposite direction from my apartment so
  that I could go inside a coffee shop instead of leading him to my home.<br/><br/>-Some
  random guy reaching up my skirt at a house party in college and grabbing me before
  I could get away from him (note to self: was this Donald Trump?).<br/><br/>-Practically
  jogging down a steep sidewalk in San Francisco and darting into a cell phone store
  just to lose the guy who had been following me after I refused to date him.<br/><br/>-Ignoring
  countless men who cat called from cars, from sidewalks, from the seemingly innocuous
  "Hey beautiful" to the much more obnoxious "Wanna fuck?"<br/><br/>-Dealing with
  cat callers calling me a bitch or saying I shouldn''t walk outside looking like
  that (how else should I look if not like myself?) when I ignore their advances.<br/><br/>-Having
  well intentioned men tell me to take these types of situations as a compliment,
  not understanding that I actually feared for my safety.<br/><br/>Sex Object is not
  a humorous book. Jessica Valenti says as much in her introduction: many feminists
  use humor and inspiration to get their message across, but it''s also okay to be
  serious (even if people on the internet call you a man hater and say they would
  only screw you if you were gagged). I definitely recommend this to young women who
  consider this type of behavior normal, who don''t consider themselves feminists.
  This is not normal. And we should all be feminists.'
