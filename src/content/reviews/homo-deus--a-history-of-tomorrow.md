My Review: 'This may have been the worst work of purported nonfiction I have ever
  read. I actually described this book to a colleague by comparing it to a conversation
  between a group of smart people who each just took a large bump of cocaine. It’s
  impassioned, but rambling, filled with speculation but lacking any coherent argument.
  In short, it’s a mess.<br/><br/>Generally, I dislike appeals to authority, but I
  feel I should preface this by saying that I am an expert in cognitive science, and
  I’ve been working with data for well over a decade. Unfortunately, the way cognitive
  science research is presented in this book is not grounded within the scope of the
  empirical findings. Indeed, I often found myself scratching my head trying to figure
  out how Harari got from, say, Gazzaniga’s research on split-brain patients to the
  idea that we’re all going to be ruled by computer-algorithm overlords and rich cyborgs.
  <br/><br/>The main problem is that Harari writes as if his ideas are grounded in
  reality, when, in truth, they’re pure fiction. If you’re interested in speculative
  futurism, go watch Star Trek or read The Expanse. And, if you’re looking for a discussion
  of the future grounded in current scientific research, do yourself a favor and give
  this incoherent piece of drivel a hard pass. '
