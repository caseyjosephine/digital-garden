My Review: 'I don’t know why everyone talks about this book being so difficult to
  read.<br/><br/>Sure, Infinite Jest is challenging, with the massive amounts of footnotes
  and obscure references and esoteric vocabulary; I finished that book feeling like
  I’ve got all the eloquence of Ron Burgundy. Reading Ulysses sometimes feels like
  tossing the pieces to every puzzle you own together in a trash bag, mixing them
  around, getting really drunk, then trying to put all the puzzles together on your
  living room floor. I’m convinced that Proust may have been in cahoots with a time
  traveler who slipped him an early version of a computer whose only working function
  was string concatenation.<br/><br/>Gardens of the Moon is more like watching The
  Usual Suspects, or Reservoir Dogs, or Twin Peaks: at the beginning, you have no
  idea what’s going on, but if you just go with it the story will build itself around
  you and you’ll feel smart because you figured it out.<br/><br/>To be fair, that
  kind of storytelling just doesn’t appeal to everyone. Taking as evidence the inordinate
  amount of times I’ve been asked by a friend in a movie theater “what’s happening?”
  even though <i>we’re both watching the movie for the first time and I also have
  no idea what’s happening which is why I’ve decided to just keep watching, so please
  stop bothering me</i>, some people have an easier time with uncertainty than others.
  If you’re cool with Naomi Watts being both Betty and Diane simultaneously, you might
  like Gardens of the Moon. If you think Bladerunner is better with the voiceover,
  then maybe this book isn’t for you.<br/><br/>Actually, I was surprised to experience
  a cozy sense of nostalgia in being left in the dark. When I was little, a day off
  of school meant watching Days of Our Lives with my mom. I would watch the characters
  do all these things, with no information about their motivation and backstory. I
  would have to build my understanding by piecing together their actions. And, when
  I figured it out, it felt good. But I haven’t had that experience in a long time.
  In the days of Netflix and Hulu and HBO Go, my default mode is to start from the
  very beginning, and shows rarely ask me to puzzle things out.<br/><br/>To come back
  to Gardens of the Moon, I think what appealed to me about this book was that alienation
  felt like a novel experience. And, I don’t know why, but I liked it. So bring on
  the next nine books.'
