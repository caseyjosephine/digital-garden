My Review: 'I just sent the following text message to a dear bookish friend of mine,
  explaining why I wasn''t completely enamored with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas:<br/><br/>"But
  really, Hunter S. Thompson talking about being super high is fun for like, the first
  two mentions of reptiles everywhere but then it’s like, dude, maybe lay off the
  mescaline and get a plot or something."<br/><br/>And, basically, the sums it up,
  but perhaps here I should expand on that a bit. Fear and Loathing is supposed to
  be a subversive book about all manner of hallucinogenic drugs, pills, weed, alcohol,
  and general debauchery. It''s the kind of book that teenagers who wouldn''t dare
  to actually take LSD might dare to claim as their favorite book, in a vain attempt
  to convince the kids that are actually into LSD that they are, in fact, cool. <br/><br/>There''s
  not much of a plot here, and the drug use is reminiscent of anything one might see
  at any unremarkable summer music festival. The main difference is that the pseudo-Thompson
  character is supposed to be working in Vegas whilst on all these drugs, which seems
  like a somewhat bad idea. I mean, mescaline and writing serious journalistic pieces
  don''t seem like they''d mix particularly well. Then again, hallucinogens would
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-YUtVNT34w">explain some of the more bizarre
  Fox News interviewing techniques</a>.<br/><br/>Anyway, I''m sure that high school
  students who want to be cool will continue to read this and then brag about having
  read this, and no one will really care. But it''s all good, because eventually these
  high schoolers will turn into college students who might be able to participate
  in actual Vegas trips, where they will discover that what actually happens in Vegas
  is a lot more interesting and unpredictable than this quasi-counterculture pseudo-intellectual
  bullshit. '
