My Review: 'Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote "I hold that a wise man will write nothing
  but that which is known only to himself and that he will not produce his truth until
  it is imperatively demanded by the exigencies of the conversation which has arrived
  at that point. So is the shrine and pedestal ready, so he produces his statue and
  fills the eye."<br/><br/>With her "book" A Visit From the Goon Squad (in reality,
  a disjointed collection of short stories), Egan does exactly the opposite: she figures
  out what is is imperatively demanded by the exigencies of society, then fakes relevancy.
  The result: a shallow book "about" music and life and technology, that isn''t actually
  about anything.<br/><br/>Throughout the "book," Egan throws out references. She
  references San Francisco punk rock bands, and Facebook, and drug culture, and academia.
  It becomes clear to the reader, however, that she cares very little about music.
  Indeed, one detects palpable schadenfreude in Egan''s writing, because it''s clear
  that she wants these cool musicians to get what''s coming to them.<br/><br/>Thinking
  about it, the issue with A Visit form the Goon Squad is "coolness." Egan desperately
  wants to be cool. She talks about foreign locations and drugs and music because
  it''s "cool." She creates "cool" characters. She even does a chapter in PowerPoint.
  Egan isn''t in the music business, and she has said "any expertise I might seem
  to possess is purely the product of research." (<a href="http://www.audiogo-library.com/TradeHome/AuthorSpotlights/tabid/56/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/184/A-QA-with-Jennifer-Egan-on-A-Visit-from-the-Goon-Squad.aspx">AudioGo
  Interview</a>) Clearly, she didn''t do her research well enough: everyone knows
  that trying hard to be cool makes you completely uncool. Although, I guess she fooled
  the Pulitzer committee.'
