My Review: '3.5 stars, but I''m rounding down because this was far longer than it
  needed to be.<br/><br/>I''m not even going to bother to tell you what a Golem or
  a Jinni is: other people have tried, and it really does make sense once you start
  reading. This is a story about outsiders to humanity, acting in a way that comes
  as unnaturally to them as it comes naturally to us. This is some nice fodder for
  both philosophical treatises on humanity and, by proxy, the immigrant experience.
  Unfortunately, the book never does this quite as effectively as, say, [b:The Unbearable
  Lightness of Being|9717|The Unbearable Lightness of Being|Milan Kundera|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1265401884s/9717.jpg|4489585]
  or [b:The Jungle|41681|The Jungle|Upton Sinclair|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1332140681s/41681.jpg|1253187].<br/><br/>But
  that''s not my big issue with this: after all, most books aren''t as good as the
  two I just mentioned. My problem was that it seemed that Wecker didn''t know whether
  she wanted to write an updated fairy tale, or a sweeping epic narrative, or a quiet
  book about humanity, or an action-packed adventure story. So she kind of just wrote
  them all, and as a result things got a little muddled, to put it mildly. Thus, the
  pacing changed about 2/3 of the way into the book, characters I thought I knew did
  180s on me, and story lines that should have stayed separate suddenly coalesced
  in a way that was so awkward I literally rolled my eyes while eating a grilled cheese
  sandwich at Panera. The exact moment this book completely lost me was when <spoiler>we
  found out that Joseph Schall, the creator of the Golem, was also the reincarnation
  of wizard that capture the Jinni. Come on.</spoiler><br/><br/>You''d think someone
  with an MFA would know better than to throw all regard to cohesive narrative structure
  out the window. Then again, it''s possible that the MFA just convinces writers that
  they''re totally allowed to break all the rules because, like, they already know
  them all. It''s a good thing Tolstoy never got an MFA: I''m sure it would have drastically
  reduced his ability to write well.<br/><br/>Anyway, that''s not to say this book
  wasn''t fun: it was. It actually reminded me of the kind of mindlessly magical,
  adventuresome stuff that [a:Neil Gaiman|1221698|Neil Gaiman|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1234150163p2/1221698.jpg]
  writes, and a lot of people seem to really like that. It''s not exactly for me though.<br/><br/>My
  recommendation is to read [b:The Snow Child|11250053|The Snow Child|Eowyn Ivey|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1327098624s/11250053.jpg|16176521]
  instead: [a:Eowyn Ivey|4823432|Eowyn Ivey|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1327102553p2/4823432.jpg]
  managed to do the realistic modernish fairy tale without any dubious coincidences,
  and in less than 400 pages to boot.'
