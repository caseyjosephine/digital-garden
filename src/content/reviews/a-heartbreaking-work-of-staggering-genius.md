My Review: Please understand that, in this context, "heartbreaking" means "self-consciously
  maudlin" and "staggering genius" means "derivative drivel." It really is work, though.<br/><br/>Have
  you forgotten why you don't spend time around twenty-two year olds? Do you want
  to relive your youthful naivety by reading prose that is probably supposed to be
  self-consciously ironic but comes across as a little too earnest ("All we really
  want is for no one to have a boring life, to be impressive, so we can be impressed")?
  Do you enjoy associating with people who claim they grew up poor because they weren't
  the richest kids in their very wealthy suburb, who feel comfortable expressing highly
  racist opinions because they agree with the importance for appearing to care about
  diversity, at least on a conceptual level? Do you believe that dealing with a real
  tragedy somehow gives people free rein to be complete douchebags? Well, then, this
  is the book for you!<br/><br/>I get that the nostalgic elements of this book have
  something to do with zines and the Real World, but there's an incommensurability
  about Gen-X angst that I can't work through, that makes me want to run into Winona
  Ryder somewhere (The Gap, probably?) and tell her that I sat through all of Reality
  Bites twice and I still have no idea what she was talking about. Perhaps there has
  simply been a paradigm shift, in which case I'm glad, although I have the lingering
  suspicious that my generation is similarly obnoxious in a novel way, in which case
  mea culpa.
