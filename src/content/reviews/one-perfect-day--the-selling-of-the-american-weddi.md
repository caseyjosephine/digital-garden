My Review: 'I''m currently experiencing the twenty-something wedding deluge: it seems
  like getting married is all anyone does nowadays. I''ve spent a lot of time listening
  to details, reassuring friends that no one will really notice if they decide to
  save money by forgoing the aisle runner, while gently suggesting that they focus
  more of the budget on booze. Of course, I''ve also spent a lot of money on showers,
  parties, dresses, and cookware that, as an obsessive cook, I have a hard time packing
  up and sending to the bridge and groom.<br/><br/>At some point, I had a wedding-gift
  related breakdown. My kitchen was filled with cheap mis-matched pots and completely
  devoid of serve ware. I desperately wanted a Le Creuset dutch oven, and a Kitchenaid
  standing mixer, and some All Clad sauté pans; however, I had taken for granted the
  fact that unmarried women don''t deserve nice things. As I once again forked over
  my credit card to buy a kitchen item that I had long coveted for an acquaintance
  whose idea of cooking was tossing some jarred sauce over pasta, I started to get
  fed up. Screw it, I decided. I was an educated woman with my own damn apartment
  and I didn''t need to live like an ascetic until the day came that I could ask my
  family and friends to buy me the escargot plates I so desired. I indulged myself
  with a cherry red Kitchenaid mixer.<br/><br/>In One Perfect Day, Rebecca Mead points
  out that marriage no longer marks a transition from the parental home to a new life
  in a new family unit. People get married later, usually long after they get the
  keys to their first apartment. Indeed, many couples cohabitate, and have already
  acquired a perfectly serviceable set of flatware. Yet, somehow, the wedding industry
  convinces the affianced that the wedding represents their one chance to finally
  get overpriced knife blocks and unnecessary creme brûlée pans. Thus, what began
  as a way to help clueless youngsters begin a modest life in a new home has turned
  into an all-out gift grab. Awesome.<br/><br/>Mead blames the industry, not the bridezillas
  themselves. She talks about the fantasy of the handmade wedding dress, then describes
  the reality of the Chinese factories were these dresses are mass-produced. She describes
  videographers who sell the idea that watching you wedding video will make your marriage
  stronger (I cringe at the idea of seeing myself on film, and I can''t imagine that
  anyone would want a video of their wedding, let alone ever watch it. Better to spend
  the money to buy a top-notch photographer, the one wedding professional whose services
  are actually worth the cost. But I digress). Not that there are great ways to opt-out,
  as elopement has also become part of the wedding industrial complex.<br/><br/>This
  isn''t a particularly weighty account of the issue, which is why I''m only giving
  the book three stars, but it is an interesting read. I do recommend it for anyone
  who, like me, finds themselves inundated with wedding invitations. Just try not
  to bring up these topics at the wedding receptions. Instead, try to focus on the
  real meaning of the ceremony: people watching and free booze (and really, there
  better be free booze).'
