Flipped through this at a friend's house back in my Santa Barbara days. The way to get skinny: become completely malnourished, eating only vegetables and large helpings of sanctimoniousness. The nutrition advice is terrible (no known society has ever thrived on a vegan diet, and of course, vegans need to take B12 supplements because they don't get all the essential nutrients from real food). But hey, more bacon for me.<br/><br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ovs5w.jpg">
