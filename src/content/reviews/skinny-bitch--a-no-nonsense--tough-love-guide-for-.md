My Review: 'Flipped through this at a friend''s house back in my Santa Barbara days.
  The way to get skinny: become completely malnourished, eating only vegetables and
  large helpings of sanctimoniousness. The nutrition advice is terrible (no known
  society has ever thrived on a vegan diet, and of course, vegans need to take B12
  supplements because they don''t get all the essential nutrients from real food).
  But hey, more bacon for me.<br/><br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ovs5w.jpg">'
