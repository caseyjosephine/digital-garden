My Review: I don't know why I consistently pick up popular books and then get annoyed
  while reading them. There's a part of me that wants escapism, but there's another,
  stronger, part that rolls my eyes at the plodding plots and bare-minimum characterization
  that so often mar bestseller type books (including, unfortunately, this one).<br/><br/>The
  first book was idiotic in a charming way. The titular project was amusing, the plot
  didn't feel terribly contrived, the setting was interesting. The second book threw
  all of that out the window, most notably with the lack of a real plot. Rosie's going
  to have a baby. Don treats it as a project and is not emotionally supportive. That's
  not really a plot, because having two married people have a child doesn't exactly
  involve conflict. That’s exposition. Conflict is necessary to drive a plot; without
  conflict, there’s nothing to build towards a climax. If you want to get away with
  writing a book without a plot, you better be James fucking Joyce.<br/><br/>Anyway,
  this book finds our characters treading water in New York City, starting small-yet-contained
  fires so that they can put them out a few chapters later. The poor attempt at rising
  action is punctuated by bougie wish fulfillment. The characters befriend a rock
  star! The characters go to Momofuku Ko! The characters cook fancy dinners and eat
  them with expensive wine! Now, I’m an oenophile and foodie and I love good food
  writing, but this does not read like M.F.K. Fisher. Instead, this reads like a writer
  who wants his characters to seem “cool” and “hip.” Readers who are actually hip
  are engaging in some dramatic eye-rolling behind those thick, plastic-framed glasses.<br/><br/>I
  can’t recommend this book, even if you liked the first. If you want to turn off
  your brain with something light and funny and charming, just turn on your tv and
  watch a marathon of The Big Bang Theory. Grab the Momofuku cookbook, cook yourself
  some noodles, pair with a nice bottle of wine (may I suggest German Riesling labelled
  Beerenauslese; these sweet wines are often affected by Botrytis and pair nicely
  with many asian cuisines, especially dishes on the spicier side). That would be
  a much more satisfying experience.
