My Review: While I had heard about the Stand from friends of mine, it wasn't until
  I found out that the producers of my favorite show, Lost, love it that I started
  to read it. What I found was a fantastic journey through a darkly terrifying world
  that only Stephen King could create.<br/><br/>At the start of the book, the world
  becomes infected with the Superflu, also known as Captain Trips, which kills off
  most of the world's population. The survivors begin to wander, not knowing where
  to go, until they begin to have the same dream. Their dreams seem to lead the way
  to the west, where they will set up camp in Colorado. But there is another dream,
  that warns of someone dark rising in Las Vegas. <br/><br/>I wish I could rate this
  as five stars, but there were a few fundamental issues I had with the book that
  keep me from doing so. The first is sheer length; my copy of the book tops out at
  1141 pages. This wouldn't be that much of a problem in itself, but I often felt
  there wasn't as much action as their should be to drive the plot over that many
  pages. I do, however, realize that this is the uncut version, so I know that criticism
  doesn't carry as much weight as it would with a trade release. Another problem was
  that the main conflict of the book didn't really gear up until more than halfway
  through, when it probably could have started much sooner. Finally, the ending (which
  I won't go into) left a bit to be desired.<br/><br/>That said, I would urge anyone
  with a little time on their hands to pick up The Stand. Stephen King's plague infected
  world is as scary as it is real, and its characters will stay with you long after
  you've finished the book. If you do feel like tackling this great read, it's definitely
  worth the time invested.
