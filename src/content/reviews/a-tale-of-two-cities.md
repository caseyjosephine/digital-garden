My Review: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auzfTPp4moA">Off with your head<br/>Dance
  'til you're dead<br/>Heads will roll<br/>Heads will roll<br/>Heads will roll<br/>On
  the floor</a><br/><br/>Here's what I knew about A Tale of Two Cities before I read
  it:<br/><br/>-It starts with "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."<br/>-Charles
  Dickens wrote it<br/>-The two cities are Paris and London<br/>-It involves something
  about the French Revolution<br/><br/>A Tale of Two Cities is a weird book; I'm taken
  to understand that it's kind of a departure from the type of stuff Dickens typically
  wrote. I liked it, but I'm not exactly sure how much I liked it. It's about the
  reign of terror, so you probably won't be surprised to hear that it's not particularly
  uplifting. There's a lot of ominous knitting, though, so that's cool.<br/><br/><spoiler>I'm
  not sure what to think about the ending. It felt a little too...convenient I guess.
  I don't really get Carton's motivation for sacrificing himself for Darnay. Actually,
  I don't much get anyone's motivations for anything, and I think that's what prevents
  me from thinking this book is truly brilliant.</spoiler>
