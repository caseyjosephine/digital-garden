My Review: 'This book probably deserves three and a half stars, but it did prompt
  me to listen to a soundtrack of hippie music as I read. Pink Floyd''s Dark Side
  of the Moon, Led Zeppelin''s Houses of the Holy, The Grateful Dead''s American Beauty.
  For that, it gets bumped up to four stars.<br/><br/>Arcadia chronicles the life
  of Bit, "the littlest bit of a hippie," from his birth in Arcadia, the commune where
  he lives until he turns 14, to his middle age. Bit has always been small (maybe
  because he''s commune was fed a vegan diet, and the poor thing had to grow up on
  soy egg replicas), and his smallness allows him to observe the world without notice.
  Like Bit, Lauren Groff allows her readers to glimpse his strange world, without
  enough agency to actually effect change. As you may expect, the commune cannot survive
  forever; indeed, Groff foreshadows its demise from the first chapter of the book.<br/><br/>Groff
  takes the views of her hippie characters seriously, but she does not venerate their
  "I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together" lifestyle. It''s easy
  to see the folly of the radical right: those who live in fear of knowledge, who
  believe that the only way to peace is through gun ownership. I find it more difficult
  to envision the extremes of my heathen, organic, liberal existence. Reading Arcadia
  felt a bit like holding up a fun-house mirror to my life. Certainly, if a situation
  arose in which an interlocutor expressed an admiration for Ayn Rand (which happens
  to Bit, in the latter half of the book), I would promptly extricate myself from
  the situation (likely, not gracefully). Perhaps there is a version of me that would
  run off to join a subsistence farming co-op (or, at the very least, a locavore co-op
  in the upper Haight). Arcadia makes me wonder whether I could give up everything
  to live off the earth, and If I even think that''s a bad thing.'
