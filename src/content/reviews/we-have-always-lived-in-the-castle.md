My Review: 'I wish that someone had put this in my hands when I was going through
  my adolescent [a:R.L. Stine|13730|R.L. Stine|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1194380070p2/13730.jpg]
  and [a:Christopher Pike|19954|Christopher Pike|https://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1336315535p2/19954.jpg]
  phase. Had that happened, I could have read this at least eight or nine times already,
  and that still wouldn''t be enough. This was sordid, and fun, and I don''t understand
  why it has been turned into a Tim Burton film yet. Note to Tim Burton: get on that!<br/><br/>Giving
  up the plot would put a damper on the fun, so all I will say is that this novella
  involves poison (!), creepy (?) sisters, and a crazy ass Grey Gardens type situation.
  Also, it''s super short, so you can easily knock it out in an afternoon (which is
  great if you''re behind on your Goodreads challenge, as I am right now).<br/><br/>One
  thing I loved was <spoiler>the evil small town aspect. Growing up in an always gossipy,
  occasionally spiteful small town totally sucks, even when you''re not enveloped
  by scandal. The taunts and adults-acting-like-children scenes rang surprisingly
  true, and part of me felt that Merricat''s plan to kill them all wasn''t a terrible
  idea. Although, if I had all that money laying around, I''d just decamp to a different
  city, but then again, I''m not agoraphobic with comorbid untreated mental disorders</spoiler>.<br/><br/>Yeah,
  just read this already. I really do wish I would have read it sooner.'
