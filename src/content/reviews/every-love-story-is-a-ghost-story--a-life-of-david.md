My Review: 'As it turns out, David Foster Wallace was a pretty relatable guy. That
  sentence should strike me as jointly self-aggrandizing and portentous, but I''d
  rather believe that D.T. Max vividly captured Wallace''s personal and intellectual
  essence in his biography of the late writer. Of course, having never met David Foster
  Wallace, I have no basis for substantiating this claim, but it seems to have a feeling
  of truthiness to it, so I''ll let it slide.<br/><br/>Digression: I have always wished
  to engage in an exchange with a grammar Hitler Youth* about my use of the word portentous.
  In this fictional conversation, the so-called grammarian tells me that I mistyped
  pretentious. I duly reply by providing a definition of the word portentous (of or
  like a portent, where portent indicates a sign or warning that something, especially
  something momentous or calamitous, is likely to happen, at least in current usage).
  I explicate further that said grammarian was pretentious in his assumption that
  I, in my Flaubertesque obsession with finding le mot juste, somehow misspoke. This
  exchange, disappointingly enough, has yet to occur.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is an
  excellent introduction to the life of David Foster Wallace, especially in that Max
  manages to take his mental illness seriously without painting a portrait of Wallace
  qua depressed person. I recommend it to readers of Infinite Jest, in particular,
  both because Infinite Jest is opaque enough that the examples for the book serve
  as a nice aide memoire for forgotten passages, and because the writing of Infinite
  Jest comprises a large portion of the book. I also recommend this book to people
  who would like to have read Infinite Jest, but who are not willing to put in the
  effort involved in actually reading it. You know who you are, you flaneur-wannabes
  in black-framed glasses and bespoke skinny jeans. I''m only trying to help you pretend
  to be less of a philistine.**<br/><br/>*Most self-styled grammar nazis imagine themselves
  as high-ranking officials, fleeing Nuremberg for lives of exile in Argentina. In
  reality, their syntactical stylings place them firmly in the realm of drunk, racist
  great uncles who embarrass their family members at holiday dinners. In this metaphor,
  my background as a pragmatics expert allows me to represent America, democracy,
  and freedom.<br/><br/>**Please don''t try that shit on me, though, because I''ll
  see right through it. Your target should be the manic pixie dream girl in the corner,
  the one in the ironic t-shirt who desperately wants to discuss the solo careers
  of the members of The XX. I am, however, happy to mine my knowledge of quirky independent
  comedies to help you facilitate a meet cute.'

As it turns out, David Foster Wallace was a pretty relatable guy. That sentence should strike me as jointly self-aggrandizing and portentous, but I'd rather believe that D.T. Max vividly captured Wallace's personal and intellectual essence in his biography of the late writer. Of course, having never met David Foster Wallace, I have no basis for substantiating this claim, but it seems to have a feeling of truthiness to it, so I'll let it slide.<br/><br/>Digression: I have always wished to engage in an exchange with a grammar Hitler Youth* about my use of the word portentous.
