My Review: Hilariously poignant, Welcome to the Monkey House proves that Kurt Vonnegut
  was a master of fiction. Each self-contained story is excellent, and I find myself
  picking up this book when I have a few minutes to kill. Although all the stories
  shine, I especially enjoyed the title story, about a drug that stops sexual desire
  to curb overpopulation.
