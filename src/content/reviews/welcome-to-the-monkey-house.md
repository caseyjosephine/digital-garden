Hilariously poignant, Welcome to the Monkey House proves that Kurt Vonnegut was a master of fiction. Each self-contained story is excellent, and I find myself picking up this book when I have a few minutes to kill. Although all the stories shine, I especially enjoyed the title story, about a drug that stops sexual desire to curb overpopulation.
