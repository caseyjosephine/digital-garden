My Review: After finishing The Selfish Gene, I rushed out to the store to buy another
  of Dawkins' books. While the size of this tome was quite intimidating, I found the
  premise utterly fascinating. The narrative traces humans' evolutionary ancestry,
  from primates to "concestor zero," or the beginning of life on Earth.<br/><br/>Dawkins'
  knowledge of zoology shines as he gives examples of the fascinating animals that
  share some of our genes. Readers will undoubtedly learn about plants and animals
  they had never heard of before, from Australian marsupials to the strange creatures
  that inhabit Madagascar. The book reads like a novel, and after finishing it I feel
  more connected, not just to my own species, but to all the creatures around me that
  share in this crazy thing called life.
