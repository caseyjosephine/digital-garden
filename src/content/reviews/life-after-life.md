My Review: 'One way to completely lower the stakes in a novel is to have your protagonist
  die, over and over again, with absolutely no consequences. I hadn''t realized this
  before I picked up the incredibly over-hyped novel, Life After Life, but it hit
  me a few chapters in. Ursula is born, and dies, and is born again, and you, dear
  reader, begin to care less and less. There''s no use in becoming invested in one
  eventuality, when you know that everything is really just a hypothetical. <br/><br/>Maybe
  a different author could have done this idea justice, but maybe not: I think the
  premise is fundamentally flawed. I did find myself riveted by scenes of the Blitz
  during WWII, but I was always frustrated when these scenes ended in death, one way
  or another. I didn''t feel like investing in any of the characters, because I knew
  that they would evaporate sooner or later, replaced by another almost-but-not-quite-identical
  version of themselves. <br/><br/>People have mentioned that, if nothing else, Atkinson''s
  writing style is okay. Honestly, though, it just didn''t work for me, especially
  (I don''t know how much of this can be considered a spoiler, because nothing in
  the book really happened in the book) <spoiler>towards the end, when it devolved
  into a meandering solipsistic mess. There was no true ending, just a bunch of might
  have beens and a bunch of snow.</spoiler> Anyway, the writing here is only sometimes
  technically proficient. I think it could have used an edit, but then again there''s
  no use gilding a pile of shit, and that''s what this was.<br/><br/>If you like the
  premise, do yourself a favor and just (re)watch Groundhog Day. At least that has
  the benefit of Bill Murray. '
