My Review: This book was terrible, and I'm someone who enjoys chick lit. The Devil
  Wears Prada is a roman-a-clef by Lauren Weisberger, a mediocre writer who takes
  herself too seriously. The plot is just a series of bad decisions made by the novel's
  unlikeable protagonist Andy Sachs, who thinks the best way to become a writer for
  the New Yorker is by becoming an assistant at a Vogue style magazine for a year.
  Andy spends most of the novel whining about her mundane entry-level job and stealing
  designer clothes from the sample room. As the story unfolds, it becomes apparent
  that the author has a worrying lack of knowledge about fashion, publishing, and
  human behavior in general.<br/><br/>Sure, it's a quick read, but there are better
  things you could do with your time. Like staring at the wall, or counting the dots
  on the ceiling.
