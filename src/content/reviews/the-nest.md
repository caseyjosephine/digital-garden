My Review: 'Reading The Nest is kind of like reading Barney Stintson''s alternate
  universe fanfic take on Arrested Development. There are the ingrate children who
  get inordinately upset when their financial fortunes change, because now they might
  have to get real jobs (or, at the very least, deal with economic downturns like
  everyone else), just like the hoi polloi. No more living lives of leisure! There''s
  also a rich matriarch whose idea of maternal love is critical derision, and grandchildren
  who engage in all sorts of antics. Which is all well and good, except I get the
  message that we''re all supposed to take these rich asshole''s "problems" seriously.
  And I really do not care.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. I understand that wealthy people
  suffer too, that feelings shouldn''t be minimized just because someone else has
  it worse. Then again, I didn''t feel any real emotion from the characters, because
  the only thing they really wanted was their inheritance to fix their problems. Money
  is nice, but, once you get beyond poverty, it doesn''t buy happiness. Also, most
  of us don''t have trust funds, so seriously, just grow the fuck up and get a job
  already. Millions of hard-working Americans can''t be wrong.<br/><br/>To me, this
  book is just more evidence of a huge rift in the United States, between the haves
  and have nots, between the 1% and the ones who are just getting by. In the 1%er
  world, being comfortable is a curse, because the real goal is to be enormously wealthy.
  No work, just entitlement, followed by snide comments about the middle class, about
  Mexicans, about people who work for their money (these are straight from the book,
  by the way; one character does mental gymnastics to feel superior to a more successful
  writer because said successful writer looks Midwestern, and another character talks
  about how Mexicans have ruined Italian food, and, again, we''re supposed to feel
  empathy towards these fuckers). These are not my values, and at this point I''d
  rather spend time with Lucille Bluth than these assholes who act like their lives
  are ending because they''re getting a $50,000 windfall. So screw them. I hope they
  choke on their fictional silver spoons. '
