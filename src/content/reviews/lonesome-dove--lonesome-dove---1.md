My Review: 'If you''ve ever wondered what book qualifies as the American [b:War and
  Peace|656|War and Peace|Leo Tolstoy|http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1366570580s/656.jpg|4912783],
  well, Lonesome Dove is certainly a contender. I''m not just saying that because
  both books are quite long, or because they''re both historical fiction*. Lonesome
  Dove deals with fundamental American mythology: cowboys and Indians, civilization
  and the frontier, good and evil. Not that I used the word "and" instead of saying
  "vs," because McMurtry is one hell of a storyteller, and he wrote a nuanced book
  that''s not as black and white as your typical western.<br/><br/>Lonesome Dove became
  a favorite almost the minute I started reading it, and it''s hard for me to articulate
  what''s so ephemerally affecting about my favorite books. So, since I can already
  tell that this review is going to be rambling, I''m going to take a moment to pontificate
  about the sinusoidal cultural impact of the western. My dad, a baby boomer, grew
  up watching westerns on weekend television and playing cowboys and indians. As a
  kid, I never really got the appeal. I was lucky enough to grow up with the new golden
  age of Disney and great shows on Nickelodeon, but kids'' media didn''t really deal
  with Western themes. We had Back to the Future III, Maverick, and Wild Wild West,
  but these films weren''t particularly good and didn''t take the idea of the West
  seriously. It wasn''t until I watched The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance with my dad
  that I realized that Westerns actually rock.<br/><br/>The West of Lonesome Dove
  is soul stirring. Endless prairie as far as the eye can see, wild horses, Indians
  (both hostile and not), bears, rivers, and rattlesnakes. It''s populated by people
  that you won''t be able to forget: rakish Augustus, stolid Call, blunt Clara, quiet
  Newt. Some characters, like Jake Spoon, straddle the line between good and evil.
  Others, like Blue Duck and Elmira, are just purely evil. As you can tell from the
  cast of characters (this list isn''t exhaustive), the story is sweeping. Luckily,
  McMurtry (like Tolstoy) does a great job of giving you a sense of who these characters
  are, so you won''t have trouble keeping track of them.<br/><br/>I can''t describe
  this book except to say that you should absolutely read it. Even if you don''t like
  Westerns. Trust me.<br/><br/>*I hesitate to really say that War and Peace is historical
  fiction, because Tolstoy definitely thought he was writing a strange hybrid book
  that contained fictional and veridical sections. He didn''t even call it a novel,
  but I''m going to call it that, since it''s the word that, while not perfect, is
  the most appropriate.'
