My Review: 'Although I''ve had this book on my shelf for years, I never felt motivated
  to read it. Once my bookshelf became too full for new books, I gave it a shot, with
  the intention to donate it after reading.<br/><br/>Ridley is the type of character
  that infuriates me (should have known, considering the review from Cosmopolitan
  plastered on the cover). She seems to see herself as an independent, feminist woman,
  but she doesn''t act like one. Instead, she relies on men to take care of her, and
  narrates poor decisions that put her life in jeopardy with a glib "haha silly little
  me" attitude. <br/><br/>Besides my annoyance with the main character, the pacing
  was pretty good, and the story was interesting enough to keep me reading. However,
  it''s not a story that will stick with me long after the book has gone off the greener
  pastures.<br/><br/>I see books like this as palette cleansers: nice breaks between
  meatier courses, but certainly not good enough to make you feel sated in isolation.'
