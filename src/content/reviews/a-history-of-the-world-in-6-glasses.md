My Review: This book should really be called "A History of the Western World in 6
  Glasses," as it doesn't consider the drinks of South America, Sub-Saharan Africa,
  Oceania, and much of Asia. Indeed, tea is considered only through the lens of the
  British empire, even though the formal Japanese tea service is arguably more interesting
  than a British tea party. Even as a Western history, it kind of fails, as there's
  a large gap between wine production in the Roman empire and the distillation of
  rum in Barbados. This can only be viewed as a surface history of the world, but
  as far as surface stories go, it's pretty interesting.<br/><br/>Throughout the book,
  Standage tells the history of six beverages (beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and
  Coca-Cola) as they appeared in the historical record. This is actually not so great,
  as the book ends up talking about beer without ever mentioning Germany, and wine
  without ever mentioning France or California. Instead of bringing it all back together
  in the epilogue, he just rambles on about bottled water and (randomly) colonizing
  Mars.<br/><br/>The book also contains a shockingly uncritical depiction of the Coca-Cola
  company, which creatives a "beverage" that can best be described as a noxious substance
  that no one should be consuming, especially not on a regular basis. Unfortunately,
  the health effects of soda are not discussed.<br/><br/>I'd recommend A History of
  the World in 6 Glasses only to those interested in culinary history and esoterica.
  History buffs and general readers should skip this one.
