My Review: In Invisible Monsters, Chuck Palahniuk (the master of shock-value fiction)
  weaves a story that is both quasi-ridiculous and hugely enjoyable. Shannon, the
  former supermodel who has had half her face blown off, is the perfect narrator,
  describing the absurdest events as if they happened every day. <br/><br/>Palahniuk
  gives the reader just enough information along the way to make you read as quickly
  as you can, begging for more and hoping the story will never end. On more than one
  occasion, I said "Oh my God!" out loud as I read a shocking paragraph.<br/><br/>As
  always, Palahniuk's novel puts a new spin on our notions of beauty, family, and
  prescription medication. If you're only going to read one Palahniuk novel (although
  I don't know why you would deny yourself like that), this is the one to read.
