My Review: 'Hunting gets a bad rap. At least in the U.S., liberals (full disclosure:
  I''m very liberal) seem to think of hunters as NRA-obsessed redneck whack jobs who
  think the world would be safer if everyone shot everyone else. I''ll get my politics
  out of the way upfront: I believe in extraordinarily tight gun control, including
  extensive background checks and limits as to which types of guns can be purchased.
  I think buying a gun for "self-defense" is bullshit, and I''m disgusted by the fact
  that I live in a country where people are free to murder children on the street
  in broad daylight, without any fear of retribution. Actually, I think hunting is
  the <i>only</i> valid reason to purchase a gun.<br/><br/>However, in Call of the
  Mild, Lily Raff McCaulous dispels the "hunters as gun-crazed rednecks" stereotype.
  A liberal herself, she notes that only a small percentage of gun owners actually
  hunt, and that these hunters seem to care more about the environment than urban,
  vegan Prius owners. Raff McCaulou took up hunting, not because her parents hunted,
  but because she wanted to feel more connected to the source of her food.<br/><br/>I
  found this to be a thought-provoking memoir, especially since it presents a balanced
  viewpoint of what it means to hunt. Raff McCaulou notes the hypocrisy of animal-loving
  vegetarians who despise hunting on principle, as hunting is usually necessary for
  population control. She writes "Before I began to hunt, I thought of animals as
  individuals, with families and emotions and a whole slew of anthropomorphic traits.
  This strikes me as the environmentalist, vegetarian, animal lover''s approach: Any
  death of any individual being is painful and bad. The trouble is, I now think of
  animals as members of a population and as individuals. It makes for a lot of hand-wringing.
  But maybe it''s a necessary paradox; it''s what makes me a responsible hunter."
  She also notes that, in one survey, 60% of self-identified vegetarians ate meat
  within the last 24 hours. Not that she''s trying to skewer vegetarians. Instead,
  she calls into question the idea that the best thing for animals is for people to
  blindly adopt a vegetarian diet. Like most difficult issues, it''s much more complicated
  than that.<br/><br/>This isn''t a well-known book, which is a shame. I heartily
  recommend it, especially for foodies who dig the farm to table concept. '
