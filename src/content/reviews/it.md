My Review: '"We all float down here." - Pennywise <br/><br/>"Alright, already, we''ll
  all float on, alright<br/>Don''t worry even if things end up a bit too heavy<br/>We''ll
  all float on, alright." - Modest Mouse<br/><br/>The threshold between childhood
  and adulthood feels murky while you''re crossing it. As an adult, it''s hard to
  remember the last time you turned off the lights downstairs, then ran up the stairs
  as fast as you could to keep the darkness from chasing you. But there was a last
  time, wasn''t there?<br/><br/>IT is not a story about an evil clown. While it is
  a masterwork of eldritch horror, the genre is simply a means to an end. No, IT is
  at once a Bildungsroman that captures the transition away from childhood, and an
  examination of the effect of childhood trauma. IT is an ouroboros of a story, which
  is why it''s going to take me awhile to wrap my head around it.   <br/><br/>One
  idea from IT that fascinates me is how adults forget the things that seemed important
  to them as children. I''ve experienced the existential crisis of looking through
  old yearbooks and not recognizing the people I posed with in candid shots. Classmates
  signed the pages with references to inside jokes that I don''t remember. Facing
  the fallibility of remembrance is terrifying. That''s part of what makes IT universally
  scary. '
