My Review: What a romp! This book felt relatable right from the title. Money troubles,
  in this economy? Yep, that sounds right. <br/><br/>Once I started the book, I began
  regaling my coworkers with synopses. A young woman hooks up with her super creeper
  married professor and gets pregnant. She has the baby, and it's expensive, so she
  starts an Only Fans account. Her dad is a former professional wrestler, and he mentors
  her in creating a persona. <br/><br/>The book was completely wacky, and I loved
  every moment. Rufi Thrope is a gifted writer who wields a simile better than my
  teenage nephew wields his impromptu architectural skills whilst playing Fortnite
  (yes, that reference is plot-relevant).<br/><br/>Good to know that, as a wrestling
  persona, I’m probably a heel, not a face. I suspected as much, but I haven’t watched
  wrestling since the WWF days, so I wasn’t aware of the nomenclature.
