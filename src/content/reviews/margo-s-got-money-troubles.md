What a romp! This book felt relatable right from the title. Money troubles, in this economy? Yep, that sounds right. <br/><br/>Once I started the book, I began regaling my coworkers with synopses. A young woman hooks up with her super creeper married professor and gets pregnant. She has the baby, and it's expensive, so she starts an Only Fans account. Her dad is a former professional wrestler, and he mentors her in creating a persona. <br/><br/>The book was completely wacky, and I loved every moment. Rufi Thrope is a gifted writer who wields a simile better than my teenage nephew wields his impromptu architectural skills whilst playing Fortnite (yes, that reference is plot-relevant).<br/><br/>Good to know that, as a wrestling persona, I’m probably a heel, not a face. I suspected as much, but I haven’t watched wrestling since the WWF days, so I wasn’t aware of the nomenclature.
