My Review: 'This was a well written, and exceptionally fun, historical account of
  Maria Theresa and three of her daughters. <br/><br/>I wanted to give it four stars,
  but I can''t. That''s because Nancy Goldstone asserts that two of Marie Antoinette''s
  children were sired by Count Axel von Fersen as historical fact. However, this is
  speculation, and feels academically dishonest. <br/><br/>Now I''m not a (an?) historian,
  but I''ve never seen definitive evidence that Louis Charles and Sophie were fathered
  by Fersen. As far as I can tell, the only "source" for this assertion is a poorly-received
  work of popular history by Evelyn Farr. Even Marie Antoinette''s affair with Fersen
  is speculative. Given his status at court and the surviving correspondence between
  him and the Queen, it does seem likely that they were involved romantically, but
  the evidence isn''t definitive. <br/><br/>Anyway, as a casual reader I don''t mind
  Goldstone editorializing in the footnotes. But I find baseless claims to be intellectually
  unethical. And I think it''s particularly important to combat misinformation during
  these obnoxiously interesting times in which we live. <br/><br/>To end on a high
  note, Maria Carolina is one of the most interesting historical figures I never learned
  about in school. '

This was a well written, and exceptionally fun, historical account of Maria Theresa and three of her daughters. <br/><br/>I wanted to give it four stars, but I can't. That's because Nancy Goldstone asserts that two of Marie Antoinette's children were sired by Count Axel von Fersen as historical fact.
