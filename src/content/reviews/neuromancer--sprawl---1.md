My Review: 'I cringe when I hear someone say that a book is a classic <i>of science
  fiction.</i> What they mean is that the book has been well liked by a narrow subset
  of readers, without any real value to elevate it out of a genre and into the realm
  of literature. Neuromancer is supposed to be both revolutionary and incredibly well
  written, but  it doesn’t live up to the hype. Instead, it rehashes a simplistic
  yet still absurd noir plot with two-dimensional characters and a style so unnecessarily
  befuddling that it renders the book almost unreadable.<br/><br/>This  purported
  “classic” of science fiction consists mostly of nonsensical techno-drivel punctuated
  by unexpected graphic sex. For example “Case flipped to cyberspace and sent a command
  pulsing down the crimson thread that pierced the library ice.” It’s hard to tell
  what’s going on here, because the technology that Gibson created don’t consist of
  anything more than of a sloppy vomit of invented jargon. I can’t tell how prescient
  the technology was, because it’s hard to make any sense of it at all.<br/><br/>And
  the plot. It starts out promising: a hacker who got banned from cyberspace after
  screwing over an employer gets one last chance to work, but the job is shrouded
  in mystery. It stays interesting for about two chapters, and then becomes completely
  absurd. At one point, the whole crew randomly ends up in space, and we meat a brand
  new hackneyed Rastafarian character who actually says, and I quote, “You ver’ pale,
  mon…maybe you wan’ eat somethin’.” Which just made me think of this:<br/><br/><img
  src="http://www.caseyjosephine.com/images/gifs/fonzie.jpg"><br/><br/>The only consentual
  mass hallucination going on here is that of the mainstream science fiction apologists,
  who put forward books like Neuromancer, Foundation, and Do Androids Dream of Electric
  Sheep? as if they could stand up to the likes of Anna Karenina, Ulysses, or even
  Pride and Prejudice. They can’t. I don’t mean to imply that I’m turned off of the
  genre forever, but I’m done expecting these “classics” to hold their own as literature.
  Suits me well enough, anyway: I’ve always found Science Fiction to be at its best
  when it doesn’t take itself too seriously.'
