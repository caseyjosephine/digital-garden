My Review: '3.5 Stars.<br/><br/>I grew up in a small mountain town, which probably
  explains why I''ve been running away from wilderness for much of my adult life.
  I sometimes dreamed that I had to walk 5,000 feet down, on a stretch of highway,
  in order to get to civilization. These were literal dreams (actually, literal nightmares).
  I enjoy short walks in the woods, but I find being stuck in them to be fairly suffocating.<br/><br/>After
  reading this, as well as [b:Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail|12262741|Wild  From
  Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail|Cheryl Strayed|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1354159655s/12262741.jpg|17237712],
  I think I understand why people would hike for hundreds of miles through mountainous
  terrain with a pack on their back and only noodles for food. The toughness seems
  like a great way to become mindful of existence, to enjoy the feeling of being.
  They do it for the same reason that I contort myself into yoga poses on a regular
  basis: to get themselves out of their head, to enjoy life. And I get it.<br/><br/>But
  I''m sure as hell not going to do it.'
