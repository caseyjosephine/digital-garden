I short book that can be read it a sitting, A Man Without a Country is a touch irreverent, a bit indulgent, and as funny as we've come to expect from the writer of Cat's Cradle and Breakfast of Champions. In his last book, Vonnegut shares a collection of experiences that is sure to give readers insight into the life of the man who was one of the great writers of the 20th century.
