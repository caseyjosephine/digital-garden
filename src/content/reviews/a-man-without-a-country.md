My Review: I short book that can be read it a sitting, A Man Without a Country is
  a touch irreverent, a bit indulgent, and as funny as we've come to expect from the
  writer of Cat's Cradle and Breakfast of Champions. In his last book, Vonnegut shares
  a collection of experiences that is sure to give readers insight into the life of
  the man who was one of the great writers of the 20th century.
